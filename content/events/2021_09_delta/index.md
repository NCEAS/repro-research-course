We propose to hold 3 one-week facilitated synthesis and training events
for Delta researchers that will revolve around scientific computing and
scientific software for reproducible science. We will (1) develop an
online curriculum, (2) provide data consulting, (3) include in-person
training and facilitated synthesis, and (4) conduct a remote workshop to
conclude the group synthesis projects.

The course will focus on techniques for data management, scientific
programming, synthetic analysis, and collaboration techniques through
the use of open-source, community-supported tools. Participants will
learn skills for rapid and robust use of open source scientific
software. These approaches will be explored and applied to scientific
synthesis projects related to the Delta ecosystem.

The course will weave together several core themes which are reinforced
-- and injected into the real-time synthetic scientific research process
-- through work on group synthesis projects.

## Schedule

Week 1: September 13-17, 2021. Remote.
Week 2: October 25-29, 2021. UC Davis.
Week 3: November 1-5, 2021. UC Davis.
