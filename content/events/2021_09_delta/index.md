We propose to hold 3 one-week facilitated synthesis and training events for Delta researchers that will revolve around scientific computing and scientific software for reproducible science. We will (1) develop an online curriculum, (2) provide data consulting, (3) include in-person training and facilitated synthesis, and (4) conduct a remote workshop to conclude the group synthesis projects.  

The course will focus on techniques for data management, scientific programming, synthetic analysis, and collaboration techniques through the use of open-source, community-supported tools. Participants will learn skills for rapid and robust use of open source scientific software. These approaches will be explored and applied to scientific synthesis projects related to the Delta ecosystem.
 
The course will weave together several core themes which are reinforced – and injected into the real-time synthetic scientific research process – through work on group synthesis projects
