__Location__: Remote <br>

In the Long-term Remote Program, Cohorts of research groups participate over a four-month period, with two Cohort Calls each month. Calls are designed to be engaging, requiring discussion and active participation through live-notetaking in Google Docs and video Zoom (group and breakouts).

[Openscapes](https://openscapes.org/) is operated by the National Center for Ecological Analysis & Synthesis (NCEAS) and is being incubated by a Mozilla Fellowship awarded to [Julia Stewart Lowndes](http://jules32.github.io/).
