__Dates__: March 29, 2022<br>
__Location__: Arctic Science Summit Week<br>
__Venue__: Tromso, Norway

This workshop is a collaboration between the Arctic Data Center, ELOKA and the NNA Community Office, and will focus on the presentation of open science principles and best practices. Open science will be explored from the lens of reproducibility of research, Indigenous data sovereignty, and community data management. A combination of presentation and discussion will introduce participants to key topics, detail current recommended practices and highlight areas for future research. During the second part of the workshop, participants will have the opportunity to explore data organization and the principles of ‘tidy’ data structures through practical hands-on and small group activities.
