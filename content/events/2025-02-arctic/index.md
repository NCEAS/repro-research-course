__Dates__: February 24 - 28, 2025<br>
__Location__: Online<br>
<!--__Venue__: [NCEAS](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu), 735 State St., Suite 300, UC Santa Barbara-->

This 5-day remote workshop will provided researchers with an overview of best data management practices, data science tools for cleaning and analyzing data, and concrete steps and methods for more easily documenting and preserving their data at the Arctic Data Center. Example tools included R, Rmarkdown, and git/GitHub. This course provided background in both the theory and practice of reproducible research, spanning all portions of the research life cycle, from ethical data collection following the CARE principles to engage with local stakeholders, to data publishing..

## Overview:

Workshop topics will include:

* Literate analysis (Quarto),
* Data wrangling (tidyr/dplyr),
* Data publishing,
* Visualization (ggplot2/sf),
* Code versioning (git),
* Ethical data procedures (CARE principles)
