      <description>In collaboration with the Delta Science Program, we are running a 12-month facilitated research synthesis activity, supported by 3 one-week intensive training events. Curriculum material will focus on introducing Delta Researchers to best practices in, and application of, scientific computing and scientific software for reproducible science. In addition to developing and delivering learning curriculum, this collaboration will include the provision of data consulting, synthesis facilitation, and a remote workshop to conclude the group synthesis activities.</description>
