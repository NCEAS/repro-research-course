      <description>We propose to hold 3 one-week facilitated synthesis and training events for Delta researchers that will revolve around scientific computing and scientific software for reproducible science. We will (1) develop an online curriculum, (2) provide data consulting, (3) include in-person training and facilitated synthesis, and (4) conduct a remote workshop to conclude the group synthesis projects.
The course will focus on techniques for data management, scientific programming, synthetic analysis, and collaboration techniques through the use of open-source, community-supported tools.</description>
