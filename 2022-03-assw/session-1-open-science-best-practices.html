<p>Reproducibility is a hallmark of scientific research, which is based on empirical observations coupled with explanatory models. Whether integrating data from across multiple studies and sources, or working with your own data, the data life cycle typically involves some degree of data collection/integration, quality assurance practices, analysis and synthesis. Operating in a reproducible fashion means that each of these steps can be easily re-executed to achieve the same result, ideally as part of a single workflow.</p>
<p>Reproducibility means different things to different researchers. For our purposes, practical reproducibility looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preserving the data</li>
<li>Preserving the software workflow</li>
<li>Documenting what you did</li>
<li>Describing how to interpret it all</li>
</ul>
<p>Reproducibility does not, by definition, require openness. Reproducibility can be achieved within a single research activity or across a research program with a closed group of collaborators. However, when working in an OPEN and REPRODUCIBLE manner, we are better able to transform knowledge into benefits for society. In this section we will expand on the benefits of reproducible research and open science before highlighting some best practices.</p>
</div>
<div id="why-is-reproducible-research-important" class="section level3 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h3>Why is reproducible research important?<a href="session-1-open-science-best-practices.html#why-is-reproducible-research-important" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Working in a reproducible manner builds efficiencies into your own research practices. The ability to automate processes and rerun analyses as you collect more data, or share your full workflow (including data, code and products) with colleagues, will accelerate the pace of your research and collaborations. However, beyond these direct benefits, reproducible research builds trust in science with the public, policy makers and others.</p>
<p><img src="images/Smith-et-al.png" /></p>
<p>What data were used in this study? What methods applied? What were the parameter settings? What documentation or code are available to us to evaluate the results? Can we trust these data and methods?</p>
<p>Are the results reproducible?</p>
<p><img src="images/OSC.png" /></p>
<p>Ionnidis (2005) contends that “Most research findings are false for most research designs and for most fields”, and a study of replicability in psychology experiments found that “Most replication effects were smaller than the original results” (Open Science Collaboration, 2015).</p>
<p><img src="images/NCA.png" /></p>
<p>In the case of ‘climategate’, it took three years, and over 300 personnel, to gather the necessary provenance information in order to document how results, figures and other outputs were derived from input sources. Time and effort that could have been significantly reduced with appropriate documentation and reproducible practices. Moving forward, through reproducible research training, practices, and infrastructure, the need to manually chase this information will be reduced enabling replication studies and great trust in science.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.2</span> Open Science<a href="session-1-open-science-best-practices.html#open-science" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>To enable full reproducibility by the broader community; researchers, practitioners, policy makers etc, all products of the research activity need to be accessible - open data, open code, and open publications. Further, full research transparency also requires open peer review. There are, of course, data sensitivities and ethical considerations regarding open everything and these will be discussed later.</p>
<p><img src="images/open-science.png" /></p>
<p>At its core, the aims of Open Science are to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Increase transparency of the research process</li>
<li>Enable reproducibility of results and conclusions</li>
<li>Accelerate discovery</li>
<li>Enhance and facilitate collaboration</li>
<li>Increase diversity, equity and inclusion</li>
<li>Transform knowledge into benefits for society</li>
</ol>
<div id="computational-reproducibility" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Computational reproducibility<a href="session-1-open-science-best-practices.html#computational-reproducibility" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Computational reproducibility is the ability to document data, analyses, and models sufficiently for other researchers to be able to understand and ideally re-execute the computations that led to scientific results and conclusions.</p>
<p>To be able to evaluate the data, analyses, and models on which conclusions are drawn, computational reproducibility requires open science approaches, including straightforward steps for archiving data and code openly along with the scientific workflows describing the provenance of scientific results (e.g., <span class="citation">Hampton et al. (<a href="#ref-hampton_tao_2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>, <span class="citation">Munafò et al. (<a href="#ref-munafo_manifesto_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>).</p>
<p>Scientific workflows encapsulate all of the steps from data acquisition, cleaning,
transformation, integration, analysis, and visualization.</p>
<p><img src="images/workflow.png" /></p>
<p>Workflows can range in detail from simple flowcharts
to fully executable scripts. R scripts and python scripts are a textual form
of a workflow, and when researchers publish specific versions of the scripts and
data used in an analysis, it becomes far easier to repeat their computations and
understand the provenance of their conclusions.</p>
<p>Computational reproducibility provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>transparency by capturing and communicating scientific workflows</li>
<li>research to stand on the shoulders of giants (build on work that came before)</li>
<li>credit for secondary usage and supports easy attribution</li>
<li>increased trust in science</li>
</ul>
<p>Preserving computational workflows enables understanding, evaluation, and reuse for the benefit of <em>future you</em> and your collaborators and colleagues <strong>across disciplines</strong>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.3</span> Community Principles: CARE and FAIR<a href="session-1-open-science-best-practices.html#community-principles-care-and-fair" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>In facilitating use of data resources, the community have converged on principles surrounding best practices for open data management. One set of these principles is the <a href="https://force11.org/info/guiding-principles-for-findable-accessible-interoperable-and-re-usable-data-publishing-version-b1-0/">FAIR principles</a>: <strong>Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reproducible</strong>. FAIR principles and open science are overlapping, but distinct concepts. Open science supports a culture of sharing research outputs and data, and FAIR focuses on how to prepare the data.</p>
<p><img src="images/FAIRsFAIR.png" /></p>
<p>Another set of community developed principles surrounding open data are the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d3799de845604000199cd24/t/5da9f4479ecab221ce848fb2/1571419335217/CARE+Principles_One+Pagers+FINAL_Oct_17_2019.pdf">CARE Principles</a>. The CARE principles for Indigenous Data Governance complement the more data-centric approach of the FAIR principles, introducing social responsibility to open data management practices. The CARE Principles stand for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collective Benefit</li>
<li>Authority to Control</li>
<li>Responsibility</li>
<li>Ethics</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/FAIR_CARE.png" /></p>
<p>The CARE principles align with the FAIR principles by outlining guidelines for publishing data that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reproducible while at the same time, accounts for Indigenous’ Peoples rights and interests. Initially designed to support Indigenous data sovereignty, CARE principles are now being adopted across domains, and many researchers argue they are relevant for both Indigenous Knowledge and data, as well as data from all disciplines (Carroll et al., 2021). These principles introduce a “game changing perspective” that encourages transparency in data ethics, and encourages data reuse that is purposeful and intentional that aligns with human well-being aligns with human well-being (Carroll et al., 2021).</p>
<p>These will be discussed more comprehensively during the data ethics section of the workshop.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.4</span> Metadata Best Practices<a href="session-1-open-science-best-practices.html#metadata-best-practices" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Well structured and described data unpin the FAIR principles and we’ll visit how best to organize your data in a tidy and effective manner (in both theory and practice) shortly. Here we focus on metadata best practices.</p>
<p>Metadata (data about data) is an important part of the data life cycle because it enables data reuse long after the original collection.
Imagine that you’re writing your metadata for a typical researcher (who might even be you!) 30+ years from now - what will they need to understand what’s inside your data files?</p>
<p>The goal is to have enough information for the researcher to <strong>understand</strong> the data, <strong>interpret</strong> the data, and then <strong>re-use</strong> the data in another study.</p>
<p>Another way to think about it is to answer the following questions with the documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li>What was measured?</li>
<li>Who measured it?</li>
<li>When was it measured?</li>
<li>Where was it measured?</li>
<li>How was it measured?</li>
<li>How is the data structured?</li>
<li>Why was the data collected?</li>
<li>Who should get credit for this data (researcher AND funding agency)?</li>
<li>How can this data be reused (licensing)?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Bibliographic Details</em></strong></p>
<p>The details that will help your data be cited correctly are:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>global identifier</strong> like a digital object identifier (DOI);</li>
<li>a <strong>descriptive title</strong> that includes information about the topic, the geographic location, the dates, and if applicable, the scale of the data</li>
<li>a <strong>descriptive abstract</strong> that serves as a brief overview off the specific contents and purpose of the data package</li>
<li><strong>funding information</strong> like the award number and the sponsor;</li>
<li>the <strong>people and organizations</strong> like the creator of the dataset (ie who should be cited), the person to contact about the dataset (if different than the creator), and the contributors to the dataset</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Discovery Details</em></strong></p>
<p>The details that will help your data be discovered correctly are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>geospatial coverage</strong> of the data, including the field and laboratory sampling locations, place names and precise coordinates;</li>
<li>the <strong>temporal coverage</strong> of the data, including when the measurements were made and what time period (ie the calendar time or the geologic time) the measurements apply to;</li>
<li>the <strong>taxonomic coverage</strong> of the data, including what species were measured and what taxonomy standards and procedures were followed; as well as</li>
<li><strong>any other contextual information</strong> as needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Interpretation Details</em></strong></p>
<p>The details that will help your data be interpreted correctly are:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>collection methods</strong> for both field and laboratory data;</li>
<li>the full <strong>experimental and project design</strong> as well as how the data in the dataset fits into the overall project;</li>
<li>the <strong>processing methods</strong> for both field and laboratory samples IN FULL;</li>
<li>all <strong>sample quality control</strong> procedures;</li>
<li>the <strong>provenance</strong> information to support your analysis and modelling methods;</li>
<li>information about the <strong>hardware and software</strong> used to process your data, including the make, model, and version; and</li>
<li>the <strong>computing quality control</strong> procedures like any testing or code review.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Data Structure and Contents</em></strong></p>
<p>Well constructed metadata also includes information about the data structure and contents. Everything needs a description: the data model, the data objects (like tables, images, matricies, spatial layers, etc), and the variables all need to be described so that there is no room for misinterpretation.</p>
<p>Variable information includes the definition of a variable, a standardized unit of measurement, definitions of any coded values (such as 0 = not collected), and any missing values (such as 999 = NA).</p>
<p>Not only is this information helpful to you and any other researcher in the future using your data, but it is also helpful to search engines. The <a href="https://arcticdata.io/semantic-annotations/">semantics</a> of your dataset are crucial to ensure your data is both discoverable by others and interoperable (that is, reusable).</p>
<p>Using an example from the natural sciences, if you were to search for the character string <code>carbon dioxide flux</code> in the general search box at the Arctic Data Center, not all relevant results will be shown due to varying vocabulary conventions (ie, <code>CO2 flux</code> instead of <code>carbon dioxide flux</code>) across disciplines — only datasets containing the exact words <code>carbon dioxide flux</code> are returned. With correct semantic annotation of the variables, your dataset that includes information about carbon dioxide flux but that calls it <code>CO2 flux</code> WOULD be included in that search.</p>
<p><img src="images/semantic-search.png" /></p>
<p>Above left demonstrates a typical search for “carbon dioxide flux”, yielding 20 datasets. Above right illustrates an annotated search for “carbon dioxide flux”, yielding 29 datasets. Note that if you were to interact with the site and explore the results of the figure on the right, the dataset in red of Figure 3 will not appear in the typical search for “carbon dioxide flux.”</p>
<p><strong><em>Rights and Attribution</em></strong></p>
<p>Correctly assigning a way for your datasets to be cited and reused is the last piece of a complete metadata document. This section sets the scientific rights and expectations for the future on your data, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>citation format</strong> to be used when giving credit for the data;</li>
<li>the <strong>attribution expectations</strong> for the dataset;</li>
<li>the <strong>reuse rights</strong>, which describe who may use the data and for what purpose;</li>
<li>the <strong>redistribution rights</strong>, which describe who may copy and redistribute the metadata and the data; and</li>
<li>the <strong>legal terms and conditions</strong> like how the data are licensed for reuse.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>Ethical Data Practices</em></strong></p>
<p>Additionally, at the Arctic Data Center, we now require data submissions to include information on the level of data sensitivity and to provide a statement of ethical research practice.</p>
<p>As the primary repository for the NSF Office of Polar Programs Arctic Section, the Arctic Data Center accepts data from all disciplines. This includes data from social science research that may include sensitive data. Sharing sensitive data can pose challenges to researchers, however sharing metadata or anonymized data contributes to discovery, supports open science principles, and helps reduce duplicate research efforts. To help mitigate the challenges of sharing sensitive data, researchers submitting data now have the option to choose between varying levels of sensitivity that best represent their dataset.</p>
<p><img src="images/editor-01s.png" /></p>
<p>Within the research methods section, submitters are now asked to describe the ethical data practices used throughout their research. The information provided will be visible as part of the metadata record and this field has been added to encourage transparency in data ethics. Transparency in data ethics is a vital part of open science and sharing ethical practices encourages deeper discussion about data reuse and ethics.</p>
<p><img src="images/editor-11.png" /></p>
<p>So, how do you organize all this information? There are a number of <strong>metadata standards</strong> (think, templates) that you could use, including the <a href="https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/">Ecological Metadata Language (EML)</a>, <a href="https://www.fgdc.gov/metadata/iso-standards">Geospatial Metadata Standards</a> like ISO 19115 and ISO 19139, the <a href="https://www.fgdc.gov/standards/projects/FGDC-standards-projects/metadata/biometadata/biodatap.pdf">Biological Data Profile (BDP)</a>, <a href="https://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a>, <a href="https://dwc.tdwg.org/">Darwin Core</a>, <a href="https://www.loc.gov/standards/premis/">PREMIS</a>, the <a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mets/">Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS)</a>, and the list goes on and on. The Arctic Data Center runs on EML and has a simple to use interface that guides you through the process of creating your metadata record.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.5</span> Data Identifiers<a href="session-1-open-science-best-practices.html#data-identifiers" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Many journals require a DOI - a digital object identifier - be assigned to the published data before the paper can be accepted for publication. The reason for that is so that the data can easily be found and easily linked to.</p>
<p>At the Arctic Data Center, we assign a DOI to each published dataset. But, sometimes datasets need to be updated. Each version of a dataset published with the Arctic Data Center has a unique identifier associated with it. Researchers should cite the exact version of the dataset that they used in their analysis, even if there is a newer version of the dataset available. When there is a newer version available, that will be clearly marked on the original dataset page with a yellow banner indicating as such.</p>
<p><img src="images/newer-version.png" /></p>
<p>Having the data identified in this manner allows us to accurately track the dataset usage metrics. The Arctic Data Center tracks the number of citations, the number of downloads, and the number of views of each dataset in the catalog.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.1.6</span> Data Citation<a href="session-1-open-science-best-practices.html#data-citation" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>Data citation best practices are focused on providing credit where credit is due and indexing and exposing data citations across international repository networks. In 2014, Force 11 established a <a href="https://doi.org/10.25490/a97f-egyk">Joint Declaration of Data Citation Principles</a> that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Importance of data citation</li>
<li>Credit and Attribution</li>
<li>Evidence</li>
<li>Unique Identification</li>
<li>Access</li>
<li>Persistence</li>
<li>Specificity and Verifiability</li>
<li>Interoperability and Flexibility</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transitive Credit</strong></p>
<p>We want to move towards a model such that when a user cites a research publication we will also know:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Which data</strong> produced it</li>
<li><strong>What software</strong> produced it</li>
<li>What was <strong>derived</strong> from it</li>
<li><strong>Who to credit</strong> down the attribution stack</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/Transitive-Credit.png" /></p>
<p>This is transitive credit. And it changes the way in which we think about science communication and traditional publications.</p>

<p>Computational provenance refers to the origin and processing history of data including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Input data</li>
<li>Workflow/scripts</li>
<li>Output data</li>
<li>Figures</li>
<li>Methods, dataflow, and dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>When we put these all together with formal documentation, we create a <strong>computational workflow</strong> that captures all of the steps from inital data cleaning and integration, through analysis, modeling, and visualization.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a computational workflow from <a href="https://search.dataone.org/view/urn%3Auuid%3A3249ada0-afe3-4dd6-875e-0f7928a4c171">Mark Carls</a>, that represents a three step workflow comprising four source data files and two output visualizations.</p>
<p><img src="images/comp-workflow-1.png" /></p>
<p><img src="images/provenance.png" /></p>
<p>The screenshot of the dataset page shows how we render the workflow model information as part of an interactive user interface. You can clearly see which data files were inputs to the process, the scripts that are used to process and visualize the data, and the final output objects that are produced, in this case two graphical maps of Prince William Sound in Alaska.</p>
<p><strong>From Provenance to Reproducibility</strong></p>
<p>At the Arctic Data Center we facilitate open, reproducible science through provenance by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tracking <strong>data derivation</strong> history</li>
<li>Tracking data <strong>inputs</strong> and <strong>outputs</strong> of analyses</li>

<p>In this lesson we are going to learn what relational data models are, and how they can be used to manage and analyze data efficiently. Relational data models are what relational databases use to organize tables. However, you don’t have to be using a relational database (like mySQL, MariaDB, Oracle, or Microsoft Access) to enjoy the benefits of using a relational data model. Additionally, your data don’t have to be large or complex for you to benefit. Here are a few of the benefits of using a relational data model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Powerful search and filtering</li>
<li>Handle large, complex data sets</li>
<li>Enforce data integrity</li>
<li>Decrease errors from redundant updates</li>
</ul>
<div id="simple-guidelines-for-data-management" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Simple guidelines for data management<a href="session-1-open-science-best-practices.html#simple-guidelines-for-data-management" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>A great paper called ‘Some Simple Guidelines for Effective Data Management’ <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-borer_simple_2009" role="doc-biblioref">Borer et al. 2009</a>)</span> lays out exactly that - guidelines that make your data management, and your reproducible research, more effective.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a scripted program (like R!)</li>
</ul>
<p>A scripted program helps to make sure your work is reproducible. Typically, point-and-click actions, such as clicking on a cell in a spreadsheet program and modifying the value, are not reproducible or easily explained. Programming allows you to both reproduce what you did, and explain it if you use a tool like Rmarkdown.</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-proprietary file formats are preferred (eg: csv, txt)</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a file that can be opened using free and open software greatly increases the longevity and accessibility of your data, since your data do not rely on having any particular software license to open the data file.</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep a raw version of data</li>
</ul>
<p>In conjunction with using a scripted language, keeping a raw version of your data is definitely a requirement to generate a reproducible workflow. When you keep your raw data, your scripts can read from that raw data and create as many derived data products as you need, and you will always be able to re-run your scripts and know that you will get the same output.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use descriptive file and variable names (without spaces!)</li>
</ul>
<p>When you use a scripted language, you will be using file and variable names as arguments to various functions. Programming languages are quite sensitive with what they are able to interpret as values, and they are particularly sensitive to spaces. So, if you are building reproducible workflows around scripting, or plan to in the future, saving your files without spaces or special characters will help you read those files and variables more easily. Additionally, making file and variables descriptive will help your future self and others more quickly understand what type of data they contain.</p>
<ul>
<li>Include a header line in your tabular data files</li>
</ul>
<p>Using a single header line of column names as the first row of your data table is the most common and easiest way to achieve consistency among files.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use plain ASCII text</li>
</ul>
<p>ASCII (sometimes just called plain text) is a very commonly used standard for character encoding, and is far more likely to persist very far into the future than proprietary binary formats such as Excel.</p>
<p>The next three are a little more complex, but all are characteristics of the relational data model:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design tables to add rows, not columns</li>
<li>Each column should contain only one type of information</li>
<li>Record a single piece of data only once; separate information collected at different scales into different tables.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Data Organization<a href="session-1-open-science-best-practices.html#data-organization" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>This is a screenshot of an actual dataset that came across NCEAS. We have all seen spreadsheets that look like this - and it is fairly obvious that whatever this is, it isn’t very tidy. Let’s dive deeper in to exactly <strong>why</strong> we wouldn’t consider it tidy.</p>

<div id="multiple-tables" class="section level4 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Multiple tables<a href="session-1-open-science-best-practices.html#multiple-tables" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Your human brain can see from the way this sheet is laid out that it has three tables within it. Although it is easy for us to see and interpret this, it is extremely difficult to get a computer to see it this way, which will create headaches down the road should you try to read in this information to R or another programming language.</p>

<h4>Inconsistent observations<a href="session-1-open-science-best-practices.html#inconsistent-observations" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Rows correspond to <strong>observations</strong>. If you look across a single row, and you notice that there are clearly multiple observations in one row, the data are likely not tidy.</p>

<h4>Inconsistent variables<a href="session-1-open-science-best-practices.html#inconsistent-variables" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>

<p>This part of the training offers an introduction to ethics in the
context of open science. It was developed with input from ELOKA and
the NNA-CO, and is a work-in-progress – this is the first time we are
offering this training. The training introduces ethics issues in a
broad way and includes discussion of social science data and open
science, but the majority of the section focuses on issues related to
research with, by, and for Indigenous communities. We recognize that
there is a need for more in-depth training and focus on open science
for social scientists and others who are not engaging with Indigenous
Knowledge holders and Indigenous communities, and hope to develop
further resources in this area in the future. <strong>Many of the data
stewardship practices that have been identified as good practices
through Indigenous Data Sovereignty framework development are also
relevant for those working with Arctic communities that are not
Indigenous, although the rights frameworks and collective ownership is
specific to the Indigenous context.</strong></p>
<p>The examples we include in this training are primarily drawn from the
North American research context. In future trainings, we plan to
expand and include examples from other Indigenous Arctic contexts. <strong>We
welcome suggestions and resources that would strengthen this training
for audiences outside of North America.</strong></p>
<p>We also recognize the importance of trainings on Indigenous data
sovereignty and ethics that are being developed and facilitated by
Indigenous organizations and facilitators. In this training we offer
some introductory material but there is much more depth offered in IDS
specific trainings. We include some suggestions of organizations
offering further training in the “resources” section and encourage
participants to seek out these opportunities to deepen their
understanding. And there are several sessions this week with some of
the authors of the frameworks and protocols that will be discussed,
including:</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.2</span> Equity issues in open science<a href="session-1-open-science-best-practices.html#equity-issues-in-open-science" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p><img src="images/2022-03_assw_dataethics01.png" /></p>
<p>Arctic communities (defined as a place and the people who live there,
based on geographic location in the Arctic/sub-Arctic) are involved in
research in diverse ways - as hosts to visiting or non-local
researchers, as well as “home” to community researchers who are
leading or collaborating on research projects. Over the past decades,
community voices of discontent with standard research practices that
are often exclusive and perpetuate inequities have grown stronger. The
Arctic research community (defined more broadly as the range of
institutions, organizations, researchers and local communities
involved in research) is in the midst of a complex conversation about
equity in research aimed at transforming research practice to make it
more equitable and inclusive.</p>
<p><img src="images/2022-03_assw_dataethics02.png" /></p>
<p><strong>One of the drivers of community concerns is the colonial practice of
extracting knowledge from a place or group of people without respect
for local norms of relationship with people and place, and without an
ethical commitment to sharing and making benefits of knowledge
accessible and accountable to that place.</strong> Such approaches to knowledge
and data extraction follow hundreds of years of exploration and
research that viewed science as a tool of “Enlightenment” yet focused
exclusively on benefits to White, European (or “southern” from an
Arctic community perspective) researchers and scientists. This
prioritization of non-local perspectives and needs (to Arctic
communities) continues in Arctic research.</p>
<p><strong>One result of this approach to research has been a lack of access for
Arctic residents to the data and knowledge that have resulted from
research conducted in their own communities.</strong> Much of this data was
stored in the personal files or hard drives of researchers, or in
archives located in urban centers far from the Arctic.</p>
<p>Open science is ostensibly about making access to data and knowledge
more equitable and open and enabling reproducible research. These are
laudable goals and on the surface, could provide a counterbalance to
traditional approaches that limited Arctic community members’ access
to research data and knowledge. Because it is being implemented within
a social and institutional context that continues to perpetuate
inequities in research, however, <strong>there are significant challenges
remaining to ethically and equitably implementing open science
practices.</strong></p>
<p>Here are some examples of impediments to ethical and equitable
implementation of open science:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Many Open Science tools and practices (e.g. GitHub, non-proprietary
software) have been adopted from software development, and are not
familiar to many, even physical, scientists. This makes barriers to
implementation of open science and participation in open science
practices higher for some than for others.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the main focus areas of open science (making sure data is
archived in a clean and reusable format, open access publication)
are still not accessible for Arctic residents and others who are not
already situated within an academic environment. Open science
assumes access to tools and infrastructure, such as computers that
have reliable and low-cost or subsidized internet access.</p></li>
<li><p>These structural inequalities extend even within the
academy. Researchers and academics based in lower-income countries
have fewer provided resources and sources of support to pay for open
access fees and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00724-0?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20220317&amp;utm_source=nature_etoc&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=20220317&amp;sap-outbound-id=B4EAD742973291804C3AEF5A15DD13806C9F2C30">face greater challenges in adopting open science
practices</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/2022-03_assw_dataethics03.png" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The emphasis of open science on stakeholder and rights holder
engagement and knowledge co-production also creates unintended
challenges for Arctic communities. For example, when the National
Science Foundation’s Navigating the New Arctic initiative, which
brought millions of additional funds to Arctic research, suggested
that research projects incorporate co-production and collaboration
with Arctic communities, community representatives reported being
inundated with requests from researchers. Perhaps because NNA was
designed, in part, to bring new researchers and disciplines into
Arctic research, many of these requests were made without adequate
regard for recognized good practices for community engagement (such
as the importance of building relationships, reaching out very early
for input; communicating “early and often;” and incorporating
significant resources for community participants’ time and knowledge
into project budgets, among other things). As a <a href="https://kawerak.org/download/navigating-the-new-arctic-program-comment-letter/">letter to NSF</a>
written by Kawerak, the Association of Village Council Presidents,
the Aleut Community of St. Paul Island, and the Bering Sea Elders
Group emphasized, without adequate attention to these practices as
well as an emphasis on topics that communities have identified as
important, research will not serve community partners and will fail
to achieve its broader impact goals. (See also the <a href="https://kawerak.org/download/dec-2021-nna-follow-up-letter/">2021 update
letter</a> from the same organizations).</li>

<p><img src="images/2022-03_assw_dataethics04.png" /></p>
<p>In addition to these equity related challenges in promoting open
access, there are also <em>different disciplinary norms and requirements</em>
that can create challenges for the adoption of open science
practices. For example, traditional social science methods training
and IRB processes emphasize confidentiality and privacy. Social
scientists generally lack access to training about benefits of sharing
data. On the other hand, social scientists are often trained to be
attuned to issues of equity and access, including issues related to
information equity. Those who lack this background may not give
adequate attention or time to the process of partnering with
communities. The <a href="https://jeffersoninst.org/sites/default/files/Arctic%20Horizons%20Final%20Report%281%29.pdf">Arctic Horizons Report</a> reviewed challenges around
social science data management. In 2020, a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vv054wQNaQDH6mm5Eit2fQZT-8U-G0vq/view">workshop</a> organized by the
Arctic Data Center reviewed some of the challenges for sharing and
reusing social science data, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data heterogeneity, including “unstructured” data that is not always
well supported by data repositories;<br />
</li>
<li>A dearth of metadata support for social sciences, with repositories
not always offering relevant metadata fields;<br />
</li>
<li>A lack of “formal vocabularies” that limits findability of social
science data in searches; Limited training and support in data
management practices for social scientists; limited examples using
social science data in interdisciplinary trainings.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these challenges, a number of broader concerns about
sharing data were identified, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Concerns about proper handling of sensitive data; importance of
upholding IRB and ethics requirements, data sharing/use agreements;<br />
</li>
<li>Importance of context - researchers may feel that data reuse is too
difficult given lack of contextual knowledge;<br />
</li>
<li>Concerns about upholding Indigenous data sovereignty.</li>

<p><img src="images/2022-03_assw_dataethics05.png" /></p>
<p>The introduction of open data requirements has raised concerns about
how open data objectives such as making data freely available for use
and reuse may conflict with Indigenous Data Sovereignty and the right
of Indigenous peoples to govern their data (Rainie et al. 2019:
301). Stephanie Carroll (formerly Rainie) and colleagues (2019) have
summarized some of the data challenges for Indigenous Peoples,
including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Data collection invisibility and bias</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Insufficient involvement of Indigenous Peoples in broader
decisions/discussions about data governance, including decisions
about what data is collected, when, how, and by whom, as well as
involvement in global data governance bodies.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Even if Indigenous peoples are not part of data collection, if the
data is collected on Indigenous lands and could be used to support
decisions that impact these lands, animals, or Indigenous peoples,
they should be part of decision-making about that data.</strong></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Data access, use, and interpretation, including</strong>:</p>
<ul>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.5</span> The role of IRBs, funding agencies, and Indigenous data<a href="session-1-open-science-best-practices.html#the-role-of-irbs-funding-agencies-and-indigenous-data" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>In the <strong>United States</strong>, Institutional Review Boards (IRBs; in <strong>Canada</strong>
they are referred to as Research Ethics Boards or REBs) focus on
ensuring ethical treatment and protection of research subjects with a
particular focus on vulnerable populations and ethical management of
data. For projects proposing research that involves Indigenous peoples
in the United States, IRBs will often refer the review to Tribal IRBs,
which are research review boards established and implemented directly
by Tribal Nations. Tribal IRBs reflect and respond to community needs,
changes in research, and revisions to research policy (Around Him et
al. 2019). Oversight mechanisms range from federally registered review
bodies and policy development to community-specific frameworks and
approaches (see Around Him et al. 2019 for differentiation,
justification and authority).</p>
<p><img src="images/2022-03_assw_dataethics06.png" /></p>
<p>In addition to IRB review, universities require ethics training for
researchers who are doing research with human subjects, including
Indigenous Peoples. Many universities use the web-based, third-party
<a href="https://about.citiprogram.org/">CITI training program</a>, which offers different short courses. A basic
training course for social and behavioral science researchers covers
the history of ethical misconduct in research, how human subjects
research is defined, federal regulations that govern research
practice, assessing risk, informed consent, privacy and
confidentiality, and ethics requirements for different categories of
vulnerable populations including prisoners and children. While the
CITI human subjects trainings touch on topics related to Indigenous
peoples, they are not at all comprehensive. A CITI webinar, “<a href="https://about.citiprogram.org/news/new-webinar-available-research-with-native-american-communities-important-considerations-when-applying-federal-regulations/">Research
with Native American Communities: Important Considerations when
Applying Federal Regulations</a>” introduces more topics. The r-ETHICS
training (<a href="http://iwri.org/research/ethics/">Ethics Training for Health in Indigenous Communities Study</a>)
is starting to become an acceptable, recognizable CITI addition for
IRB training by tribal entities.</p>
<p>Specific <strong>universities</strong> have adopted tribal consultation policies (such
as the Arizona Board of Regents’ (ABOR) Tribal Consultation policy
(1-118) adopted in 2016; University of Wisconsin System Board of
Regents tribal consultation policy adopted in 2021; Washington State
University <a href="https://policies.wsu.edu/prf/index/manuals/executive-policy-manual-contents/ep41-policy-on-tribal-engagement-consultation-and-consent-for-joint-wsu-tribal-research-activities-and-projects/">EP 41</a> adopted in 2021). These policies highlight where
consultation is expected/required and what the process should be
(Marley 2019).</p>
<p>In the United States, the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/geo/opp/arctic/conduct.jsp">Inter-Agency Arctic Research Policy Committee has established the Principles for Conducting Research in the Arctic</a> (2018) with input from the Arctic research community, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be Accountable</li>
<li>Establish Effective Communication</li>
<li>Respect Indigenous Knowledge and Cultures</li>
<li>Build and Sustain Relationships</li>
<li>Pursue Responsible Environmental Stewardship</li>
</ul>
<p>IRBs are not necessarily aware of these principles but national funding agencies may use them to inform proposal reviewers about expectations for research projects that work with Arctic communities.</p>
<p><img src="images/2022-03_assw_dataethics07.png" /></p>
<p>In <strong>Canada</strong>, funding agencies have established the <strong>Tri-Council Policy
Statement on Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans</strong>; <a href="https://ethics.gc.ca/eng/tcps2-eptc2_2018_chapter9-chapitre9.html">Chapter 9</a>
focuses on research involving First Nations, Inuit and Metis. The
chapter points to the importance of addressing issues regarding access
to data and use of data with involved communities and suggests using a
research agreement to establish any limits on data use and sharing,
provisions to offer the opportunity for research participants and
collaborators to review reports and publications prior to
dissemination/publication, and to include provisions for any
anticipated secondary use of information.</p>
<p>The Tri-Council Statement has resulted in <strong>direct modifications to
institutional-level REB (Canada) processes and procedures, such as
incorporation of dedicated sections focusing on Indigenous research
ethics within University protocols</strong>. For example, the “Indigenous
Peoples and Community Engagement” section of an REB application at a
Canadian university asks researchers to “<strong>Describe arrangements for the
participating community’s/ies’ ownership and/or sharing of project
data and findings</strong>, including the OCAP principles” (see below for more on OCAP).</p>

<p><img src="images/2022-03_assw_dataethics08.png" /></p>
<p><strong>All governing entities, whether national, state, local, or tribal,
need access to good, current, relevant data in order to make policy,
planning, and programmatic decisions.</strong> Indigenous nations and
organizations have had to push for data about their peoples and
communities to be collected and shared in ethical and culturally
appropriate ways, and they have also had to fight for resources and
capacity to develop and lead their own research programs.</p>

<p><strong>Indigenous data sovereignty</strong> “…refers to the right of Indigenous
peoples to govern the collection, ownership, and application of data
about Indigenous communities, peoples, lands, and resources (Rainie et
al. 2019). These governance rights apply “regardless of where/by whom
data is held (Rainie et al. 2019).</p>
<p>Some Indigenous individuals and communities have expressed
dissatisfaction with the term “data” as being too narrowly focused and
abstract to represent the embedded and holistic nature of knowledge in
Indigenous communities. <strong>Knowledge sovereignty</strong> is a related term that
has a similar meaning but is framed more broadly, and has been defined
as:</p>
<p>“Tribal communities having control over the documentation and
production of knowledge (such as through research activities) which
relate to Alaska Native people and the resources they steward and
depend on” (Kawerak 2021).</p>
<p><strong>Indigenous data</strong> is “data in a wide variety of formats inclusive of
digital data and data as knowledge and information. It encompasses
data, information, and knowledge about Indigenous individuals,
collectives, entities, lifeways, cultures, lands, and resources.”
(Rainie et al. 2019)</p>
<p><strong>Indigenous data governance</strong> is “The entitlement to determine how
Indigenous data is governed and stewarded” (Rainie et al. 2019)</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">1.3.7</span> IDS Frameworks<a href="session-1-open-science-best-practices.html#ids-frameworks" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h3>
<p>There has been increasing emphasis on development of frameworks to
support ethical research and data stewardship grounded in Indigenous
understandings and world views. The emergence of national and global
networks focusing on Indigenous data sovereignty has supported the
development of some of these frameworks. For example, the <a href="https://www.gida-global.org/whoweare">Global
Indigenous Data Alliance (GIDA)</a> developed the CARE principles in
response to the emergence of the FAIR principles. CARE is a set of
high-level principles that are broad enough to encompass more specific
frameworks and principles developed by International and national
Indigenous networks, organizations, and Tribes. This alliance is
supported by three national networks, the <a href="https://usindigenousdata.org/">United States Indigenous
Data Sovereignty Network (USIDSN)</a>, <a href="https://www.temanararaunga.maori.nz/">Te Mana Raraunga Maori Data
Sovereignty Network</a>, and the <a href="https://www.maiamnayriwingara.org/key-principles">Maiam nayri Wingara Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander Data Sovereignty Collective</a>. The latter networks each
have worked within their respective national contexts to develop IDS
principles at a “mid-level.”</p>
<p>These frameworks are being developed at different governance levels,
from “high level” frameworks that are global in scale and therefore
more general to mid-level frameworks that are developed at a national
scale or by a subset of Indigenous Peoples/Nations (such as
circumpolar Inuit or Inuit within the national level in Canada), to
foundational level frameworks that are developed at the Tribal or
community scale.</p>
<p>It is important for researchers to be aware of the different
frameworks that can inform and guide ethical research practice and
data management. Frameworks developed at the high or mid-level do not
replace foundational frameworks. In the absence of a written framework
at the tribal/community scale, the practices of strong consultation
and engagement outlined in mid-level frameworks can help inform the
development of an ethical approach.</p>
<p><img src="images/2022-03_assw_dataethics09.png" /></p>
<p><strong>High level frameworks in support of IDS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The <strong>UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</strong>, which
recognizes the collective rights of Indigenous peoples. <strong>Article 18</strong> of
UNDRIP <strong>recognizes the right of Indigenous Peoples to participate in
decision-making</strong> about matters that affect their rights; <strong>Article 19</strong>
<strong>recognizes the requirement for states to consult and cooperate with
Indigenous Peoples to gain their Free Prior and Informed Consent</strong> on
legislation that affects them. Other international protocols such as
<strong>Nagoya Protocol</strong> on access and benefit sharing and the <strong>Cartagena
Protocol on Biosafety</strong> (UNCBD) also recognize Indigenous rights with
reference to intellectual property and the right to benefit from
Indigenous knowledge and data as the owners/stewards of that data.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d3799de845604000199cd24/t/5da9f4479ecab221ce848fb2/1571419335217/CARE+Principles_One+Pagers+FINAL_Oct_17_2019.pdf">CARE principles</a> were developed to accompany the FAIR Principles
and guide their implementation in relation to Indigenous data in a way
that is “people and purpose oriented.” They were developed by the RDA International Indigenous Data Sovereignty Interest Group and released by the Global Indigenous Data Alliance in September 2019. The CARE Principles stand for:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Collective Benefit</strong> - Data ecosystems shall be designed and function in ways that enable Indigenous Peoples to derive benefit from the data for:
<ul>
<li>Inclusive development/innovation<br />
</li>
<li>Improved governance and citizen engagement<br />
</li>
<li>Equitable outcomes</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Authority to Control</strong> - Indigenous Peoples’ rights and interests in Indigenous data must be recognised and their authority to control such data be empowered. Indigenous data governance enables Indigenous Peoples and governing bodies to determine how Indigenous Peoples, as well as Indigenous lands, territories, resources, knowledges and geographical indicators, are represented and identified within data.
<ul>
<li>Recognizing Indigenous rights (individual and collective) and interests</li>
<li>Data for governance</li>
<li>Governance of data</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Responsibility</strong> - Those working with Indigenous data have a responsibility to share how those data are used to support Indigenous Peoples’ self-determination and collective benefit. Accountability requires meaningful and openly available evidence of these efforts and the benefits accruing to Indigenous Peoples.
<ul>
<li>For positive relationships</li>
<li>For expanding capability and capacity (enhancing digital
literacy and digital infrastructure)</li>
<li>For Indigenous languages and worldviews (sharing data in Indigenous languages)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>Ethics</strong> - Indigenous Peoples’ rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle and across the data ecosystem.
<ul>
<li>Minimizing harm/maximizing benefit - not using a “deficit
lens” that conceives of and portrays Indigenous communities as
dysfunctional, lacking solutions, and in need of
intervention. For researchers, adopting a deficit lens can
lead to collection of only a subset of data while excluding
other data and information that might identify solutions,
innovations, and sources of resilience from within Indigenous
communities. For policy makers, a deficit lens can lead to
harmful interventions framed as “helping.”<br />
</li>
<li>For justice - addressing power imbalances and equity<br />
</li>
<li>For future use - acknowledging potential future use/future
harm. Metadata should acknowledge provenance and purpose and
any limitations in secondary use inclusive of issues of
consent.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/2022-03_assw_dataethics10.png" /></p>
<p><strong>The CARE principles were developed in relation to the FAIR principles
to add an ethical framework for open data</strong>, as expressed in the phrase
#BeFAIRandCARE. Although they focus on Indigenous data, <strong>they are
broadly relevant to other types of data, recognizing the rights of
different communities to control and access data by/for/about them</strong>
(Carroll et al., 2021). Complementarity and disconnect between the
FAIR and CARE principles and Open Data Charter have been discussed by
participants in the open data community (Stone &amp; Calderon 2019). While
FAIR and CARE are complementary, CARE has some overlap with the ODC as
well as a point of tension in relation to the ODC value of making data
“open by default” (Carroll et al. 2020). Stephanie Carroll and
colleagues suggest that the implementation of CARE can help clarify
and refine the intent of “open by default,” which could be defined in
a way that also upholds Indigenous data rights (Carroll et al. 2020).</p>
<p><strong>Mid-level frameworks:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The First Nations Principles of <a href="https://fnigc.ca/ocap-training/">OCAP</a> (ownership, control, access, possession). Developed by the First Nations Information Governance Centre, which has developed good educational materials explaining the principles and how to implement them, as well as a training course (available on their website; the class has a registration fee).<br />
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.inuitcircumpolar.com/project/icc-ethical-and-equitable-engagement-synthesis-report/">Inuit Circumpolar Council’s Ethical and Equitable Engagement Synthesis</a>. This synthesis summarizes the process and approach that ICC took to develop principles of ethical and equitable engagement for Inuit, which involved broad engagement and input from Inuit in Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Chukotka. ICC is working on a full set of principles, which will be released after they have gone through review.<br />

<p>In this section of the training, we focus on <strong>tools and approaches for
ethically managing community data in research projects and community
collaborations</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Community data</strong> can be defined broadly as <strong>any data that a community
feels a sense of investment in or ownership of</strong> (Johnson et al. 2021;
Pulsifer et al. 2012). (In this workshop, we are using the term
“community” to refer to a geographic place and the people who live
there).</p>
<p>Community data may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>data produced by community-engaged or led research projects;<br />
</li>
<li>data collected by external researchers that is about or relevant to
a community or the people who live there;<br />
</li>
<li>or data or information needed to guide local decision-making and
planning.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/2022-03_assw_cdm01.png" /></p>
<p>How does management of community data differ from traditional academic
approaches to data management? While many of the tools (such as data
management plans) are similar, community data management is guided by
ethical considerations and protocols discussed in the “data ethics”
part of this training. It has been said that data management is not
primarily technical but social; <strong>ethical management of community data
requires significant attention to the processes of meaningful
collaboration needed to build and maintain relationships with
communities</strong>. Community data management also requires an understanding
of the governance context, including ethics protocols. In addition,
building capacity and support for community control of data is an
important aspect of community data management. <strong>ELOKA refers to these
three aspects (governance/application of tools/capacity building) as
comprising a “community data management system.”</strong></p>

<p><strong>An MOU is a formal agreement between two or more parties that
documents the nature of the relationship and collaboration and puts
into writing specific expectations regarding data management and data
ownership. <a href="https://uas.alaska.edu/admin/mous-moas.html">Although they are not legally binding</a></strong>, they are formal
agreements to coordinate activities and as such, Universities may
require legal counsel to review an MOU. An MOU may be most useful when
a community or Tribe and a research program or institution want to lay
out terms for ongoing collaboration beyond the timeframe of a single
project, although sometimes a more formal agreement may be helpful to
establish clear expectations for cooperation at the project level.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">1.4.2.2</span> Data Management Plan (DMP)<a href="session-1-open-science-best-practices.html#data-management-plan-dmp" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>A DMP is a document used to <strong>describe the strategies and tools you will
use to manage your data through different stages in the research
lifecycle, including data collection, documentation &amp; metadata,
storage and backup, sharing &amp; reuse, and preservation</strong>. The DMP
includes plans for managing data both during active research as well
as after the project is complete. DMPs include information about:</p>
<ul>
<li>what data will be created</li>
<li>what policies will apply to the data</li>
<li>who will own and have access to the data</li>
<li>what data management practices will be used</li>
<li>what facilities and equipment will be required</li>
<li>who will be responsible for each of these activities.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://dmptool.org/">https://dmptool.org/</a> is a free, online tool
developed by the California Digital Library to guide development of
DMPs. The template is customizable based on the funder that the plan
will be submitted to. They maintain a list of funder requirements as
well as a list of public plans from other projects - you can search
them by keyword, funder, institution, language, and subject. (At the
time of this training, a keyword search for “Indigenous” had only one
result). The tool does not (yet?) incorporate IDS/CARE principles. A
similar tool, <a href="https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/">DMPonline</a>, is available from the Digital Curation
Centre.</p>
<p><strong>A data management plan should be developed during the planning phase
of a research project</strong>. Many funders explicitly require a data
management plan as part of a funding proposal. As a result, DMPs are
often put together in haste to meet a proposal deadline without a lot
of thought about ethical management of data. These DMPs are then often
set aside without a lot more thought, and as a result there is a
missed opportunity to use DMPs to deeply consider data as one of the
major legacies of a research project, with the potential to “live”
well beyond the duration of the research project. <strong>In the context of
collaborative research, data sharing and use have the potential to
create friction when they are viewed as supplementary rather than
integral to good project planning and implementation.</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/2022-03_assw_cdm02.png" /></p>
<p>Some elements of a DMP for co-produced research or research involving Indigenous Knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li>When Indigenous data is involved or when activities will be
undertaken on or near Indigenous lands/waters, or when the data
generated is relevant to Indigenous governance, the plan should
include a discussion of Indigenous data sovereignty.<br />
</li>
<li>This should include a statement of overall intent as well as a
careful review of proposed activities to ensure that they uphold
IDS principles, with reference to the relevant ethical guidelines
including any foundational or mid-level frameworks as well as the
CARE principles.<br />
</li>
<li>The foundational guidelines at the Tribal or community level, if
available, should serve as the primary resource for ethical data
management.<br />
</li>
<li>To be effective in the context of collaborative research, DMPs
should be revisited at different stages of the project to make sure
that all collaborators still feel comfortable with plans based on
how the project has evolved.</li>

<h5>Case Study<a href="session-1-open-science-best-practices.html#case-study" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h5>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atsida.edu.au/">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Data Archive</a> (ATSIDA)
suggests that researchers working in the field of Australian
Indigenous Studies ask and answer (collaboratively with communities)
the following questions as part of data management planning (also
relevant to the Arctic community and Indigenous context):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Do the participants want the data preserved?<br />
</li>
<li>Does any data need to be attributed to Traditional Knowledge holders?<br />
</li>
<li>What are the access and use constraints for data deposited?<br />
</li>
<li>How do I manage requests for re-use?<br />
</li>
<li>Do I need to make the data anonymous?<br />
</li>
<li>Can I publish the material online?<br />
</li>
<li>If material is closed to public access, how long for?</li>
<li>Do I need to dispose of any research data? If so, have I deleted
it adequately without leaving a digital footprint? (Gardiner and
Thorpe 2014)</li>

<p><img src="images/2022-03_assw_cdm03.png" /></p>
<p><strong>A data use agreement is a tool that asks users to agree to specific
requirements for use, such as providing context for the data, citing
the data in a certain way, and recognizing the rights of Indigenous
knowledge holders</strong>. For example, the SIZONet/AAOKH database, a digital
database of community contributed observations about the coastal
environment in Alaska, includes a use agreement that provides a
citation for the dataset and asks users to acknowledge the individual
observer as well as review a paper providing additional context. In
order to access the observations, an atlas user must confirm that they
will abide by these use terms.</p>

<p><img src="images/2022-03_assw_cdm04.png" /></p>
<p>Giving proper recognition to the knowledge and data contributed by
Indigenous communities and Knowledge holders is an important part of
ethical data management. <strong>When Indigenous data or community data is
shared in a digital format, for example in an online atlas or
database, it should be accompanied by a suggested citation</strong>, which will
help those who access and use the data provide the proper credit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Like all data citations, it should include a persistent identifier,
such as a DOI. Data repositories will often assist with securing a
DOI for a dataset when it is deposited.<br />
</li>
<li>To address the challenges of providing context, the citation could
be accompanied by a user guide that includes additional information
that could be useful to understand or interpret the data/knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lorisia McLeod of the James Smith Cree Nation developed templates for
citing Indigenous Elders and Knowledge Keepers in APA and MLA format
(Kornei 2021; McLeod 2021). The templates include the name of the
knowledge holder/keeper, nation/community, treaty territory (if
applicable), city/community they live in (if applicable), a brief
description or title of the teaching, personal communication (for the
APA template) and date (McLeod 2021).</p>

<p>Metadata supports data discovery, retrieval and reuse. When data are
made available for use, metadata provides a structured record that
allows users to locate data and understand how to use or
interpret it. Metadata records might contain information about how and
where the data or knowledge was collected and by whom, the storage
file type and how the data is organized.</p>

<h4 class="unnumbered"></h4>
<p>Except when efforts have been made to update metadata, <strong>much of the
metadata that describes Indigenous data in museum and library
collections uses outdated and racist terminology such as names that
were applied to Indigenous Peoples without their consent.</strong> There have
been a number of efforts within the library and archival communities
to describe these challenges and develop approaches to address
them. For example <strong>the <a href="https://indigenouslis.ca/the-use-our-words-toolkit/">“Use Our Words” Toolkit</a> by Lauren Bourdages and
Kassandra Caporiccio provides an approach to reviewing metadata in
library and archive collections to decolonize the subject terms</strong> used
to describe collections, replacing problematic terms with ones that
have been approved by Indigenous communities.</p>
<p><img src="images/2022-03_assw_cdm05.png" /></p>
<p>Metadata standards establish a common way of structuring and
understanding data. For Indigenous data, metadata description
standards need to have some flexibility so that communities can
determine what classes and terms should be used (Murphy
2019). <strong>Metadata are information sources so IDS guidelines apply to
metadata</strong> - it is important to collaborate fully on metadata
development with Indigenous community partners (Kukutai &amp; Taylor). To
give an example of how this was applied in a project context: <em>The
Atlas of Community-Based Monitoring in a Changing Arctic</em>
(arcticcbm.org) is an online inventory of CBM and Indigenous Knowledge
projects. The atlas hosts only metadata and points users to other,
project-controlled sites when observational data records or datasets
are available. Nevertheless, permission to include projects was
obtained prior to adding each record in the atlas, even when the
metadata was already available on another online site.</p>
<p>Sharing metadata, or “data about data” is one way to uphold open
science principles when sharing data is not possible/ethical (ADC
2020). <strong>The Arctic Data Center requests information about ethical
research practices as part of the metadata they ask projects to
submit</strong>. They ask researchers to:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><em>Describe how and the extent to which data collection procedures
followed community standards for ethical research practices (e.g.,
CARE Principles).</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Be explicit about Institutional Review Board approvals, consent
waivers, procedures for Co-production, data sovereignty, and other
issues addressing responsible and ethical research.</em></p></li>
<li><p><em>Include any steps to anonymize, aggregate or de-identify the
dataset, or to otherwise create a version for public
distribution.”</em></p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a new request but some early responses have required
back-and-forth to address questions and a general lack of awareness on
the part of some respondents that they should consider
community/Indigenous data interests and requirements in relation to
their research projects. For example, some respondents suggest that
there are no ethical requirements for their data because it did not
need to go through IRB review at their university, or because they do
not work directly in community settings or on tribally held
lands. These responses ignore the fact that <strong>Arctic Indigenous
residents have historic homelands that extend over vast areas, well
beyond what is officially recognized as “Tribal lands.” Additionally,
research and data produced on adjacent lands or on topics with
relevance to Indigenous governance should still be made available to
communities.</strong></p>

<p>The <a href="https://localcontexts.org/labels/traditional-knowledge-labels/">TK Labels</a> were developed by the Local Contexts project as a way to
support the management of cultural heritage data in digital
environments. <strong>The metadata labels are intended to be customized by
communities to reflect their particular rules and responsibilities in
relation to data sharing</strong> (such as sacred and/or ceremonial material,
material that has gender restrictions, seasonal conditions of use
and/or materials specifically designed for outreach purposes. They can
be adapted by using the Local Contexts Hub. <a href="https://localcontexts.org/notices/aboutnotices/">TK Notices</a> are also
available for use by <strong>institutions and researchers to recognize
Indigenous interests in collections and data</strong>. The notices can be used
to indicate openness to collaborate with a community on a particular
collection or dataset where there is not yet a label associated with
the content. These labels give researchers and other users more
information and ethical guidance about how a collection or dataset
should be used. The project has also developed <a href="https://localcontexts.org/labels/biocultural-labels/">Biocultural</a> labels and
notices and is working on developing TK licenses.</p>

<p>Increasingly, Indigenous and community data are stored in digital
formats and made available through web-based applications such as
online databases, portals, and atlases. To uphold IDS, <strong>decisions about
where to store data and who should be able to access it should be made
by a governing body or organization within the community where the
data was collected</strong> (Burrage 2020). Some projects establish a research
advisory committee to guide these types of decisions. <strong>The selection of
digital tools to manage and share community data should also be made
with the informed input and guidance of community members</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="images/2022-03_assw_cdm07.png" /></p>
<p>Digital data management and sharing tools range from basic websites to
applications designed with the aim of supporting Indigenous data
management (such as the <a href="https://mukurtu.org/">Mukurtu content management system</a> for managing
cultural heritage or the <a href="https://siku.org/">SIKU platform</a> that is designed to store and
share observational data from Arctic communities) to custom-built
tools that meet specific needs of a project or community (Johnson et
al. 2021). The selection of a tool requires consideration of a range
of factors including cost, functionality, and privacy and security of
data, among other things.</p>
<p><strong>To protect sensitive data, digital applications can employ a range of
techniques such as using password protection to limit access to all or
a portion of the data and creating public and private versions of an
application that display different datasets.</strong> Another approach is to
create aggregated or less detailed datasets for public access while
providing full access to limited community users who are given
usernames and passwords to access the sites.</p>

<p>Some communities have concerns about data being stored non-locally. In
other cases, there are no concerns about non-local data storage as
long as communities have ongoing access to data in usable
formats. <strong>Enhancing community infrastructure so that communities are
able to manage their own data, such as through a locally maintained
server, is an important component of IDS.</strong></p>
<p>Data should be reviewed (by community members) for suitability for
long-term preservation. Part of this process is setting appropriate
access conditions. Some repositories allow partially open data, where
some data is open and other data requires special permission or is
closed. Access conditions can also limit access for a certain period
of time.</p>
<p><img src="images/2022-03_assw_cdm08.png" /></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.atsida.edu.au">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Data Archive</a> has developed a
set of protocols that advocate for the return of data in a digital
form to the community at the end of the research project. This creates
the opportunity for active participation of community members in
decisions about deposit, access and use of the data (Gardiner &amp; Thorpe
2014). They note that a lack of infrastructure and support in
communities to manage digital cultural heritage presents a challenge,
however. They have been testing the <a href="https://mukurtu.org/">Mukurtu content management system</a>
as a tool to support digital repatriation.</p>

<p>Many journals have open data requirements but also have exceptions for
data with legal/ethical considerations. <strong>It is important to review a
journal’s data policies prior to deciding where to
submit/publish.</strong> Keep in mind that apart from a few journals
specializing in Indigenous Knowledge, <strong>the process of “peer review” of
academic papers does not include Indigenous Knowledge holders as
expert reviewers.</strong> This creates significant challenges for IDS, since
Indigenous Knowledge systems have their own system of “review” based
on practical recognition of what works over time, as well as the
identification and recognition of “experts” in particular topics
within each community (Loseto et al. 2020).</p>
<p>Prior to submission in academic journals, <strong>papers developed with
community and Indigenous collaborators should go through review within
the community to ensure that data was interpreted and attributed
correctly</strong> and that the community feels comfortable with choices about
what is included and how all contributors and the community are
represented. Writing about this process as part of the methodology
will help orient the reviewers and readers to how this knowledge was
reviewed by the community’s process.</p>
<p>A growing list of journals focus on or accept “Data papers”– short
papers that offer a description of datasets. This is an area of
publication where projects generating community and Indigenous data
could share information about their datasets to make them more visible
and also to raise awareness about access constraints and the reasons
for them in the context of the open science/open data movement.</p>

<p><strong>There are different opinions about whether or not it is possible to
conduct secondary analysis of Indigenous data in a way that honors and
respects Indigenous research ethics.</strong> Secondary analysis is done by
someone who was not the original researcher, so there are concerns
about the lack of relationship to the place and person/people/culture
in which the knowledge was produced. As Rachel Burrage notes:</p>
<p>“…if the creation of and sharing of knowledge is relational in
nature, this …calls into question the appropriateness of allowing a
third party to analyze knowledge that was created through a
relationship between the original researcher and the individual or
community that provided the original data” (Burrage 2020: 30).</p>
<p>On the other hand, Burrage says, many researchers who have conducted
research with or on Indigenous Peoples are not fully aware of the
cultural context and may not be any better positioned to correctly
interpret and provide context for data. It is also possible that
secondary analysis may be done by someone who is familiar with the
context (a community embedded researcher) but not the data (Burrage
2020). <strong>There may be benefits to secondary analysis for knowledge
holders and communities, including respecting and making the most of
the time that was already contributed by the individual who shared
their knowledge</strong> (so that it does not have to be shared multiple times
for different research or knowledge documentation projects).</p>
<p>One way to recenter relationship in secondary analysis is to adopt a
<strong>participatory approach that involves engaging community members from
the community where the data was collected in the data
reanalysis</strong>. This allows their knowledge of context to inform the data
interpretation, and also potentially offers a community member the
chance to become familiar with data or knowledge that they may not
have seen before (such as a set of interviews with Elders) (Burrage
2020).</p>

<p>analysis of Indigenous knowledge reflect on these questions: {- .aside}
Burrage (2020) suggests that researchers considering secondary
analysis of Indigenous knowledge reflect on these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was the original data collected in a way that is congruent with an
Indigenous research paradigm?<br />
</li>
<li>Has the data been stored and accessed according to principles of
Indigenous data sovereignty?<br />
</li>
<li>What is your relationship with the community where the data wa
originally collected?<br />
</li>
<li>How will you familiarize yourself with the epistemologies and
ontologies of the community from which the data was drawn?<br />
</li>
<li>Who might you turn to for assistance if you have questions about
particular meanings within the data, both in terms of language and
in terms of styles of speech?</li>
<li>How feasible will it be to receive feedback on your results from
the community that provided the data?</li>
<li>How will you disseminate your results in a way that it reaches the
community that provided the data?</li>
</ul>

<p>Working with community data across different stages of a project
follows many of the same practices of working with any data. This
image is an adaptation of the “Data Life Cycle” developed by DataONE,
focusing on some of the specific requirements of community data
management discussed today. In summary, data management should not be
taken for granted or addressed early in a project and then set
aside. Making data management part of the process of engagement that
is revisited throughout a project will support ethical management, use
and (when relevant) reuse of data.</p>

<p>What do you see as the benefits to your research (or to Arctic
research more generally) from applying the frameworks discussed today?
What do you see as the major impediments to adopting these frameworks
in the context of open science? How might you navigate these conflicts
within your own research project(s)?</p>
<p>Have you used any of the tools or approaches discussed in this session
to support management of community data in your projects? What has
worked well for you with these tools and where have you encountered
challenges? Are there any tools or approaches to ethical data
management that you have learned about today that are relevant to your
work and that you may apply in the future?</p>
