      <description>Dates: March 25-29, 2024
Location: NCEAS Venue: Santa Barbara, CA
This 5-day in-person workshop will provide researchers with an introduction to advanced topics in computationally reproducible research in python, including software and techniques for working with very large datasets. This includes working in cloud computing environments, docker containers, and parallel processing using tools like parsl and dask. The workshop will also cover concrete methods for documenting and uploading data to the Arctic Data Center, advanced approaches to tracking data provenance, responsible research and data management practices including data sovereignty and the CARE principles, and ethical concerns with data-intensive modeling and analysis.</description>

      <description>Friday, August 6th, 2021 10:30 AM - 1:30 PM
Session Description While graduate students in ecology learn about methods for collecting and analyzing ecological data, there is less emphasis on managing and using the resulting data effectively. This is an increasingly important skill set as the research landscape changes. Researchers are increasingly engaging in collaboration across networks, many funding agencies require data management plans, journals are requiring that data and code be accessible, and society is increasingly expecting that research be reproducible.</description>
