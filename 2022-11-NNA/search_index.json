[["index.html", "Creating Data Portals Workshop About", " Creating Data Portals Workshop November 15, 2022 About During these hands-on 60-minute workshops, participants will create a data portal on their own laptop, based on specified search criteria of their choosing. As the primary repository for the National Science Foundation’s Arctic Research Program, the Arctic Data Center accepts data from a wide variety of disciplines. The Arctic Data Center hosts user-designed data portals that are collections of data packages presented on their own page with a unique web address. Data portals provide researchers with a means to preserve information regarding a projects’ objectives, scopes, and organization of related datasets so it’s clear how to use and interpret collections of data for years to come. Portals also leverage Arctic Data Center’s metrics, which describe the project’s data packages. Information such as the total number of data packages within the portal, total volume of data, data citations, and data downloads are available from the portal webpage. Researchers can create portals to collate data according to data attributes and semantic annotations, disciplines, other themes, projects, or across projects (i.e., convergence projects).

We’re best known in the research community as a data archive – researchers upload their data to preserve it for the future and make it available for re-use. This isn’t the end of that data’s life, though. These data can then be downloaded for different analyses or synthesis projects. In addition to being a data discovery portal, we also offer top-notch tools, support services, and training opportunities. We also provide data rescue services. NSF has long had a commitment to data reuse and sharing. Since our start in 2016, we’ve grown substantially – from that original 4 TB of data from ACADIS to now over 65 TB. In 2021 alone, we saw 16% growth in dataset count, and about 30% growth in data volume. This increase has come from advances in tools – both ours and of the scientific community, plus active community outreach and a strong culture of data preservation from NSF and from researchers. We plan to add more storage capacity in the coming months, as researchers are coming to us with datasets in the terabytes, and we’re excited to preserve these research products in our archive. We’re projecting our growth to be around several hundred TB this year, which has a big impact on processing time. Give us a heads up if you’re planning on having larger submissions so that we can work with you and be prepared for a large influx of data. The data that we have in the Arctic Data Center comes from a wide variety of disciplines. These different programs within NSF all have different focuses – the Arctic Observing Network supports scientific and community-based observations of biodiversity, ecosystems, human societies, land, ice, marine and freshwater systems, and the atmosphere as well as their social, natural, and/or physical environments, so that encompasses a lot right there in just that one program. We’re also working on a way right now to classify the datasets by discipline, so keep an eye out for that coming soon. Along with that diversity of disciplines comes a diversity of file types. The most common file type we have are image files in four different file types. Probably less than 200-300 of the datasets have the majority of those images – we have some large datasets that have image and/or audio files from drones. Most of those 6600+ datasets are tabular datasets. There’s a large diversity of data files, though, whether you want to look at remote sensing images, listen to passive acoustic audio files, or run applications – or something else entirely. We also cover a long period of time, at least by human standards. The data represented in our repository spans across centuries. We also have data that spans the entire Arctic, as well as the sub-Arctic, regions. 1.1.3 Data Discovery Portal To browse the data catalog, navigate to arcticdata.io. Go to the top of the page and under data, go to search. Right now, you’re looking at the whole catalog. You can narrow your search down by the map area, a general search, or searching by an attribute. Clicking on a dataset brings you to this page. You have the option to download all the files by clicking the green “Download All” button, which will zip together all the files in the dataset to your Downloads folder. You can also pick and choose to download just specific files. All the raw data is in open formats to make it easily accessible and compliant with FAIR principles – for example, tabular documents are in .csv (comma separated values) rather than Excel documents. The metrics at the top give info about the number of citations with this data, the number of downloads, and the number of views. This is what it looks like when you click on the Downloads tab for more information. Scroll down for more info about the dataset – abstract, keywords. Then you’ll see more info about the data itself. This shows the data with a description, as well as info about the attributes (or variables or parameters) that were measured. The green check mark indicates that those attributes have been annotated, which means the measurements have a precise definition to them. Scrolling further, we also see who collected the data, where they collected it, and when they collected it, as well as any funding information like a grant number. For biological data, there is the option to add taxa. 1.1.4 Tools and Infrastructure Across all our services and partnership, we are strongly aligned with the community principles of making data FAIR (Findable, Accesible, Interoperable and Reusable). We have a number of tools available to submitters and researchers who are there to download data. We also partner with other organizations, like Make Data Count and DataONE, and leverage those partnerships to create a better data experience. One of those tools is provenance tracking. With provenance tracking, users of the Arctic Data Center can see exactly what datasets led to what product, using the particular script that the researcher ran. Another tool are our Metadata Quality Checks. We know that data quality is important for researchers to find datasets and to have trust in them to use them for another analysis. For every submitted dataset, the metadata is run through a quality check to increase the completeness of submitted metadata records. These checks are seen by the submitter as well as are available to those that view the data, which helps to increase knowledge of how complete their metadata is before submission. That way, the metadata that is uploaded to the Arctic Data Center is as complete as possible, and close to following the guideline of being understandable to any reasonable scientist. 1.1.5 Support Services Metadata quality checks are the automatic way that we ensure quality of data in the repository, but the real quality and curation support is done by our curation team. The process by which data gets into the Arctic Data Center is iterative, meaning that our team works with the submitter to ensure good quality and completeness of data. When a submitter submits data, our team gets a notification and beings to evaluate the data for upload. They then go in and format it for input into the catalog, communicating back and forth with the researcher if anything is incomplete or not communicated well. This process can take anywhere from a few days or a few weeks, depending on the size of the dataset and how quickly the researcher gets back to us. Once that process has been completed, the dataset is published with a DOI (digital object identifier). 1.1.6 Training and Outreach In addition to the tools and support services, we also interact with the community via trainings like this one and outreach events. We run workshops at conferences like the American Geophysical Union, Arctic Science Summit Week and others. We also run an intern and fellows program, and webinars with different organizations. We’re invested in helping the Arctic science community learn reproducible techniques, since it facilitates a more open culture of data sharing and reuse. Overall, the Arctic Data Center provides three week-long courses for the Arctic community. Upcoming courses and past courses can be found online under the “Learn” tab. You can also find the previous courses’ curricula on the “Past Courses” page to walkthrough the lessons on your own. We strive to keep our fingers on the pulse of what researchers like yourselves are looking for in terms of support. We’re active on Twitter to share Arctic updates, data science updates, and specifically Arctic Data Center updates, but we’re also happy to feature new papers or successes that you all have had with working with the data. We can also take data science questions if you’re running into those in the course of your research, or how to make a quality data management plan. Follow us on Twitter and interact with us – we love to be involved in your research as it’s happening as well as after it’s completed. 1.1.7 Data Rescue We also run data rescue operations. We digitiazed Autin Post’s collection of glacier photos that were taken from 1964 to 1997. There were 100,000+ files and almost 5 TB of data to ingest, and we reconstructed flight paths, digitized the images of his notes, and documented image metadata, including the camera specifications. 1.1.8 Who Must Submit Projects that have to submit their data include all Arctic Research Opportunities through the NSF Office of Polar Programs. That data has to be uploaded within two years of collection. The Arctic Observing Network has a shorter timeline – their data products must be uploaded within 6 months of collection. Additionally, we have social science data, though that data often has special exceptions due to sensitive human subjects data. At the very least, the metadata has to be deposited with us. Arctic Research Opportunities (ARC) Complete metadata and all appropriate data and derived products Within 2 years of collection or before the end of the award, whichever comes first ARC Arctic Observation Network (AON) Complete metadata and all data Real-time data made public immediately Within 6 months of collection Arctic Social Sciences Program (ASSP) NSF policies include special exceptions for ASSP and other awards that contain sensitive data Human subjects, governed by an Institutional Review Board, ethically or legally sensitive, at risk of decontextualization Metadata record that documents non-sensitive aspects of the project and data Title, Contact information, Abstract, Methods For more complete information see our “Who Must Submit” webpage Recognizing the importance of sensitive data handling and of ethical treatment of all data, the Arctic Data Center submission system provides the opportunity for researchers to document the ethical treatment of data and how collection is aligned with community principles (such as the CARE principles). Submitters may also tag the metadata according to community develop data sensitivity tags. We will go over these features in more detail shortly. 1.1.9 Summary All the above informtion can be found on our website or if you need help, ask our support team at support@arcticdata.io or tweet us @arcticdatactr!

Researchers can now easily view project information and datasets all in one place. 2.1 What is a Portal? A portal is a collection of Arctic Data Center data packages on a unique webpage. Typically, a research project’s website won’t be maintained beyond the life of the project and all the information on the website that provides context for the data collection is lost. Arctic Data Center portals can provide a means to preserve information regarding the projects’ objectives, scopes, and organization and couple this with the data files so it’s clear how to use and interpret the data for years to come. Portals also leverage Arctic Data Center’s metric features, which create statistics describing the project’s data packages. Information such as total size of data, proportion of data file types, and data collection periods are immediately available from the portal webpage. 2.2 Portal Uses Portals allow users to bundle supplementary information about their group, data, or project along with the data packages. Data contributors can organize their project specific data packages into a unique portal and customize the portal’s theme and structure according to the needs of that project. Researchers can also use portals to compare their public data packages and highlight and share them with other teams, as well as the broader Arctic research audience. To see an example of a portal, please view the Toolik Field Station’s portal. 2.3 Portal Features Published portals vary in their design according to the needs and preferences of the individual or group. However, when constructing a portal there are three core elements: a data page, a metrics page, and customizable free-form pages. Flexible Content Creation Portals can be constructed as a website providing information about the research and products. Using our flexible ‘free-form’ pages (written in markdown), you can add and re-order pages to meet your needs. These pages might be used as a home, or ‘landing’ page with general project information. They are also used to showcase research products, and communicate news and upcoming events. Curated Collections of Data The data page is arguably the most important component of the Arctic Data Center portal system. This is where users will display the data packages of their choice. Whether these data reflect research products from your research group (collated based on contributor IDs), or thematic areas of research interest (collated based on keyword and search terms), will depend upon the intended use of the portal but in all cases, you are refining the suite of data viewed by your audience. The data page looks and performs just like the main Arctic Data Center catalog - with some added bonuses, see below. Customized Search Capabilities You can also build more precise search capabilities into your portal, leveraging the rich metadata associated with data products preserved at the Arctic Data Center. For example, in the example below the research group have identified seven primary search categories and within these, enable users to search within specific metadata fields or else select from a drop down list of options. In doing so, your audience can construct refined search queries drilling down to the data of interest. (Note that although the SASAP portal is hosted by DataONE, the same functionality exists at the Arctic Data Center. More on this later). Metrics, Metrics, Metrics As with the full Arctic Data Center catalog, we aggregate metrics for the collection of data packages within a portal. This page is not customizable - it comes as a default with the portal - but you can choose to delete it. The metrics provided include a summary of the holdings: number, volume, time period, format of datasets, metadata assessment scores, citations across all packages, and counts of downloads and views. These latter metrics can be particularly useful if wanting to track the usage or reach of your project or group’s activities. 2.4 Enhancing Access to Social Science Research Data Many of the portal examples provided above are organizational, individual or project portals created by members of the Arctic research community. The ability to group relevant datasets and customize search criteria, increases data discoverability and accessibility among target audiences. The Arctic Data Center has leveraged these features to create a specific portal for social science datasets. Within this portal users can subset by social science discipline, data type and other metadata fields built into the portal. These search features depend on sufficient user contributed metadata describing the dataset, and can be seen from the ‘with data’ toggle, the portal does not require the data themselves to be uploaded to the Arctic Data Center. 2.5 Relationship between Arctic Data Center portals and DataONE Both DataONE and the Arctic Data Center use Metacat and MetacatUI software and both have the capability for individuals and groups to develop portals. This is true of other repositories running this software. The difference between a portal at teh Arctic Data Center and one through DataONE is the corpus of data that can be pulled into your portal. Arctic Data Center portals expose only data held in the Arctic Data Center repository. A portal in DataONE can expose data from across the full network of data repositories - including DataONE. This is particularly useful for interdisciplinary research projects, labs that have published data to multiple repositories etc. However, unlike at the Arctic Data Center, there is a cost associated with a DataONE portal as they are part of the organizations sustainability model. 2.6 Creating Portals A step-by-step guide on how to navigate the Arctic Data Center and create a new portal. For video tutorials on how to create your first portal, please visit the Arctic Data Center’s website. Getting Started with Portals There are two methods to create portals on our site, both of which require being logged in. If you are on the Arctic Data Center’s primary website, hover over the ‘Data’ tab, and select the ‘Portals’ option. This will take you to the Portals page where you can view all public portals. If you are logged in, you will be able to see the button labeled ‘+ New Portal’, which will then take you directly to the page where you can start customizing your portal. Alternatively, if you are logged in with your ORCID and on the Dataset Search page, you can also get to the page to create a new portal by hovering on your name in the upper right hand corner. From there, a dropdown will appear and you can select ‘My Portals’. On your profile settings page, select ‘My Portals’. After the page loads select the green button ‘+ New Portal’ to add a new portal, you’ll automatically be directed to a fresh edit session. Portal Settings Page In a new edit session, the first page you’ll be taken to is the settings page where you’ll be able to add details about your portal. Portal URL Identify a short name for your portal that will become part of the URL. If the name is available, a label will indicate it’s available and if the name is taken already, it will note that the name is already taken. This feature ensures the portals are unique. Portal description Sharing options For the purposes of this training, please leave your portal in ‘Private’ status. You are welcome to return and make the portal public when the portal is complete and is useful to you and others. Permissions Adding collaborators to help you create your portal is as straightforward as copying and pasting in their ORCID into the box below the permissions section. You can choose whether the collaborator can view, edit, or is an owner of the portal. You can have multiples of each role. Partner Logos Adding Data to Portals When selecting the data tab you will see a page with two sections. These are titled with instructive statements to help explain their function: Add filters to help people find data within your collection build search features for others to use within your portal Add data to your collection construct a search to populate your portal with data We’re going to start with the second section. When adding data to your collection, you can include any of the datasets that are available at the Arctic Data Center. You build rules based on metadata to define which datasets should be included. Of course, where metadata is incomplete or abbreviated, this will impact your results. Data added to the network in the future that match these rules will also be added to your collection. The first thing we notice is the ability to include/exclude data based on all/any metadata criteria. This setting applies across all rules. In the default view you have the starting point for a single rule, and a view showing 0 datasets. As we build rules, the page will refresh to show how many datasets are included based on your rule structure. You can continue to add rules (and rule groups) to create complex queries that are specific to your needs. The metadata fields available for rule construction are easily visible in the dropdown option (don’t forget to scroll!), and grouped for ease of use. You also have the option to define ‘any metadata field’ though your results may be less precise. A recently added feature allows users to search for an attributes’ semantic annotation. Building Search Options for Your Audience This section covers the first part of the ‘data’ page. “Add filters to help people find data within your collection”. Although it appears first, I recommend constructing these filters after you have defined your data as you will have a better understanding of the metadata field that are relevant to your portal collection. It appears at the top of this editor page as when published, it will be at the top for users, hence the editor page reflects the layout of the published page. When selecting “add a search filter” you will be presented with a pop-up that comprises three primary elements. The metadata filed you will be querying The way in which you want the user to interact with that metadata Language settings for the filter you are building As you select options for number 1 - the metadata field, the pop-up will refresh to show only those relevant options. Save this filter to close the pop-up, return to the main editor and add another search filter. Data Package Metrics As stated above, the metrics page is a default function provided by the Arctic Data Center. This page cannot be edited and cannot be viewed while editing. Users do have the option to delete the page if they’d like. To delete the page, select the arrow next to the word ‘Metrics’ in the tab and choose ‘Delete’ from the dropdown list. You can alwys change your mind and add a metrics page with the ‘+’ tab. To see metric summaries, navigate to your portal in view mode. See Saving and Editing Portals for more information on how to view portals. Creating Unique Freeform Pages To watch a tutorial on creating a new freeform page see this video:Creating a Freeform Text Page To add a freeform page to a portal, select the ‘+’ tab next to the data and metric tabs and then choose the freeform option that appears on screen. A freeform page will then populate. Easily customize your banner with a unique image, title, and page description. To change the name of the tab, click on the arrow in the ‘Untitled’ tab and select ‘Rename’ from the dropdown list. Below the banner, there is a markdown text box with some examples on how to use the markdown formatting directives to customize the text display. There is also a formatting header at the top to assist if you’re unfamiliar with markdown. As you write, toggle through the Edit and Preview modes in the markdown text box to make sure your information is displaying as intended. Portals are flexible and can accommodate as many additional freeform pages as needed. The markdown header structure helps to generate the table of contents for the page. Please see these additional resources for help with markdown: Markdown reference Ten minute tutorial For a longer example where you can also preview the results, checkout the Showdown Live Editor Saving and Editing Portals Be sure to save your portal when you complete a page to ensure your progress is retained. Whenever a portal is saved, a dialogue box will pop up at the top of the page prompting users to view their private portal in view mode. You can choose to ignore this and continue editing. To delete a page from your portal, select the arrow in the tab you want to remove and choose ‘Delete’ from the dropdown. Users can view and edit their portal from their ‘My Portals’ tab. First, hover over your name in the top-right corner to drop down your menu options. Then, select ‘My Portals’ from the dropdown underneath your name. See the section on Getting Started with Portals for more details. Click on the portal title to view it or select the edit button to make changes. 2.7 How to Publish Portals New portals are automatically set to private and only visible to the portal creator. The portal will remain private until the owner decides to make it public. To make your portal public, go into the settings of your portal. Under the description, you’ll see a new section called ‘Sharing Options’. You can toggle between your portal being private and your portal being public there. 2.8 Sharing Portals In order to share a published portal, users can simply direct recipients to their unique identifier. Portal identifiers are embedded into the Arctic Data Center’s portal URL: https://arcticdata.io/catalog/portals/portal-identifier To view or edit your portal identifier, go into edit mode in your portal. In the settings page, your portal URL will be the first item on the page. 2.9 Tutorial Videos For video tutorials on how to create your first portal, please visit the Arctic Data Center video tutorial page. 2.10 Acknowledgements Much of this documentation was composed by ESS-DIVE, which can be found here.
