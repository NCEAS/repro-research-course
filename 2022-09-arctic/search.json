    "text": "This 5-day in-person workshop will provide researchers with an introduction to advanced topics in computationally reproducible research in python and R, including software and techniques for working with very large datasets. This includes working in cloud computing environments, docker containers, and parallel processing using tools like parsl and dask. The workshop will also cover concrete methods for documenting and uploading data to the Arctic Data Center, advanced approaches to tracking data provenance, responsible research and data management practices including data sovereignty and the CARE principles, and ethical concerns with data-intensive modeling and analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that by participating in this activity you agree to abide by the NCEAS Code of Conduct.\n\n\n\n\nIn this course, we will be using Python (> 3.0) as our primary language, and VS Code as our IDE. Below are instructions on how to get VS Code set up to work for the course. If you are already a regular Python user, you may already have another IDE set up. We strongly encourage you to set up VS Code with us, because we will use your local VS Code instance to write and execute code on one of the NCEAS servers.\n\n\nFirst, download VS Code if you do not already have it installed.\nNext, if you aren’t sure, check to make sure you have Python installed. To do this, from the terminal run:\npython3 --version\nIf you get an error, it means you need to install Python. Here are instructions for getting installed, depending on your operating system.\n\nWindows: Download and run an installer from Python.org.\nMac: Install using homebrew. If you don’t have homebrew installed, follow the instructions from their webpage.\n\nbrew install python3\n\n\nAfter you run your install, make sure you check that the install is on your system PATH by running python3 --version again.\n\n\n\nThis section summarizes the official VS Code tutorial. For more detailed instructions and screenshots, see the source material\nFirst, install the Python extension for VS Code.\nOpen a terminal window in VS Code from the Terminal drop down in the main window. Run the following commands to initialize a project workspace in a directory called training. This example will show you how to do this locally. Later, we will show you how to set it up on the remote server with only one additional step.\nmkdir training\ncd training\ncode .\nNext, we will select the Python interpreter for the project. Open the Command Palette using Command + Shift + P (Control + Shift + P for windows). The Command Palette is a handy tool in VS Code that allows you to quickly find commands to VS Code, like editor commands, file edit and open commands, settings, etc. In the Command Palette, type “Python: Select Interpreter.” Push return to select the command, and then select the interpreter you want to use (your Python 3.X installation).\n\n\n\nTo make sure you can write and execute code in your project, create a Hello World test file.\n\nFrom the File Explorer toolbar, or using the terminal, create a file called hello.py\nAdd some test code to the file, and save\n\nmsg = \"Hello World\"\nprint(msg)\n\nExecute the script using either the Play button in the upper-right hand side of your window, or by running python3 hello.py in the terminal.\n\nFor more ways to run code in VS Code, see the tutorial\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, download the Jupyter extension. You can create a test Jupyter Notebook document from the command pallete by typing “Create: New Jupyter Notebook” and selecting the command. This will open up a code editor pane with a notebook that you can test.\n\n\n\n\nThese written materials reflect the continuous development of learning materials at the Arctic Data Center and NCEAS to support individuals to understand, adopt, and apply ethical open science practices.
