    "text": "This 5-day in-person workshop will provide researchers with an introduction to advanced topics in computationally reproducible research in python and R, including software and techniques for working with very large datasets. This includes working in cloud computing environments, docker containers, and parallel processing using tools like parsl and dask. The workshop will also cover concrete methods for documenting and uploading data to the Arctic Data Center, advanced approaches to tracking data provenance, responsible research and data management practices including data sovereignty and the CARE principles, and ethical concerns with data-intensive modeling and analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease note that by participating in this activity you agree to abide by the NCEAS Code of Conduct.\n\n\n\n\nIn this course, we will be using Python (> 3.0) as our primary language, and VS Code as our IDE. Below are instructions on how to get VS Code set up to work for the course. If you are already a regular Python user, you may already have another IDE set up. We strongly encourage you to set up VS Code with us, because we will use your local VS Code instance to write and execute code on one of the NCEAS servers.\n\n\nFirst, download VS Code if you do not already have it installed.\nYou’ll also need to download the Remote - SSH extension .\n\n\n\nTo connect to the server using VS Code follow these steps:\n\nopen the command pallette (Cmd + Shift + P)\nenter “Remote SSH: Connect to Host”\nselect “Add New SSH Host”\nenter the ssh command to connect to the host as if in a terminal (ssh username@included-crab.nceas.ucsb.edu)\n\nNote: you will only need to do this step once\n\nselect the SSH config file to update with the name of the host (if prompted)\nclick “Connect” in the popup in the lower right hand corner\n\nNote: If the dialog box does not appear, reopen the command palette (Cmd + Shift + P), type in “Remote-SSH: Connect to Host…”, choose included-crab.nceas.ucsb.edu from the options of configured SSH hosts, then enter your password into the dialog box that appears\n\nenter your password in the dialog box that pops up\n\n\n\n\nAfter connecting to the server, in the extensions pane (View > Extensions) search for, and install, the following extensions:\n- Python\n- Jupyter\n- Jupyter Keymap\nNote that these extensions will be installed on the server, and not locally.\n\n\n\nLocally (not connected to the server), check to make sure you have Python installed if you aren’t sure you do. To do this, from the terminal run:\npython3 --version\nIf you get an error, it means you need to install Python. Here are instructions for getting installed, depending on your operating system. Note: There are many ways to install and manage your Python installations, and advantages and drawbacks to each. If you are unsure about how to proceed, feel free to reach out to the instructor team for guidance.\n\nWindows: Download and run an installer from Python.org.\nMac: Install using homebrew. If you don’t have homebrew installed, follow the instructions from their webpage.\n\nbrew install python3\n\n\nAfter you run your install, make sure you check that the install is on your system PATH by running python3 --version again.\nThis section summarizes the official VS Code tutorial. For more detailed instructions and screenshots, see the source material. If you already use VS Code for Python you can skip this.\nFirst, install the Python extension for VS Code.\nOpen a terminal window in VS Code from the Terminal drop down in the main window. Run the following commands to initialize a project workspace in a directory called training. This example will show you how to do this locally. Later, we will show you how to set it up on the remote server with only one additional step.\nmkdir training\ncd training\ncode .\nNext, select the Python interpreter for the project. Open the Command Palette using Command + Shift + P (Control + Shift + P for windows). The Command Palette is a handy tool in VS Code that allows you to quickly find commands to VS Code, like editor commands, file edit and open commands, settings, etc. In the Command Palette, type “Python: Select Interpreter.” Push return to select the command, and then select the interpreter you want to use (your Python 3.X installation).\nFinally, download the Jupyter extension. You can create a test Jupyter Notebook document from the command pallete by typing “Create: New Jupyter Notebook” and selecting the command. This will open up a code editor pane with a notebook that you can test.\nTo make sure you can write and execute code in your project, create a Hello World test file.\n\nFrom the File Explorer toolbar, or using the terminal, create a file called hello.py\nAdd some test code to the file, and save\n\nmsg = \"Hello World\"\nprint(msg)\n\nExecute the script using either the Play button in the upper-right hand side of your window, or by running python3 hello.py in the terminal.\n\nFor more ways to run code in VS Code, see the tutorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese written materials reflect the continuous development of learning materials at the Arctic Data Center and NCEAS to support individuals to understand, adopt, and apply ethical open science practices.

    "text": "3.4 Virtual Environments\nWhy virtual environments? We’ll answer this.\nFirst we will create a .bash_profile file to create variables that point to the install locations of python and virtualenvwrapper. .bash_profile is just a text file that contains bash commands that are run every time you start up a new terminal. Although setting up this file is not required to use virtualenvwrapper, it is convenient because it allows you to set up some reasonable defaults to the commands (meaning less typing, overall), and it makes sure that the package is available every time you start a new terminal.\nTo set up the .bash_profile. In VS Code, select ‘File > New Text File’ then paste this into the file:\nexport VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_VIRTUAWORKON_HOME=$HOME/.virtualenvs\nsource /usr/share/virtualenvwrapper/virtualenvwrapper.sh\nThe first line points virtualenvwrapper to the directory where your virtual environments will be stored. We point it to a hidden directory (.virtualenvs) in your home directory. The last line sources a bash script that ships with virtualenvwrapper, which makes all of virtualenvwrapper commands available in your terminal session.\nSave the file in the top of your home directory as .bash_profile.\nRestart your terminal, then check to make sure it was installed and configured correctly\nmkvirtualenv --version\nIt should return something like this:\nvirtualenv 20.13.0+ds from /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/virtualenv/__init__.py\nNow we can create the virtual environment we will use for the course\nmkvirtualenv -p python3.9 scomp\nHere, we’ve specified explicitly which python version to use by using the -p flag, and the path to the python 3.9 installation on the server. After making a virtual environment, it will automatically be activated. You’ll see the name of the env you are working in on the left side of your terminal prompt in parentheses. To deactivate your environment (like if you want to work on a different project), just run deactivate. To activate it again, run\nworkon scomp\nYou can get a list of all available environments by just running:\nworkon\nNow let’s install the dependencies for this course into that environment. (Note: need to figure out how to get them this file)\npython3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n3.4.0.1 Installing locally (optional)\nvirtualenvwrapper was already installed on the server we are working on. To install on your local computer, run:\npip3 install virtualenvwrapper\nAnd then follow the instructions as described above, making sure that you have the correct paths set when you edit your .bash_profile."

Items in a list can be of different data types.\n\nlist = [100, 50, -20, 'text']\nprint(list)\n\n[100, 50, -20, 'text']\n\n\nYou can access items in a list by index using the square brackets. Note indexing starts with 0 in python. The slice operator enables you to easily access a portion of the list without needing to specify every index.\n\nlist[0] # print first element\nlist[1:3] # print 2nd until 4th elements\nlist[:2] # print first until the 3rd\nlist[2:] # print last elements from 3rd\n\n100\n\n\n[50, -20]\n\n\n[100, 50]\n\n\n[-20, 'text']\n\n\nThe + and * operators work on lists by creating a new list using either concatenation (+) or repetition (*).\n\nlist2 = ['more', 'things']\n\nlist + list2\nlist * 3\n\n[100, 50, -20, 'text', 'more', 'things']\n\n\n[100, 50, -20, 'text', 100, 50, -20, 'text', 100, 50, -20, 'text']\n\n\nTuples are similar to lists, except the values cannot be changed in place. They are constructed with parentheses.\n\ntuple = ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd')\ntuple[0]\ntuple * 3\ntuple + tuple\n\n'a'\n\n\n('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd')\n\n\n('a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd')\n\n\nObserve the difference when we try to change the first value. It works for a list:\n\nlist[0] = 'new value'\nlist\n\n['new value', 50, -20, 'text']\n\n\n…and errors for a tuple.\n\ntuple[0] = 'new value'\n\nTypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\nDictionaries consist of key-value pairs, and are created using the syntax {key: value}. Keys are usually numbers or strings, and values can be any data type.\n\ndict = {'name': ['Jeanette', 'Matt'],\n        'location': ['Tucson', 'Juneau']}\n\ndict['name']\ndict.keys()\n\n['Jeanette', 'Matt']\n\n\ndict_keys(['name', 'location'])\n\n\nTo determine the type of an object, you can use the type() method.\n\ntype(list)\ntype(tuple)\ntype(dict)\n\nlist\n\n\ntuple\n\n\ndict"

Close the code chunk using three more backticks.\n\n3.6.1 Load libraries\nIn your first code chunk, lets load in some modules. We’ll use pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, requests, skimpy, and exists from os.path.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport requests\nimport skimpy\nfrom os.path import exists\n\nA note on style: There are a few ways to construct import statements. The above code uses three of the most common:\nimport module\nimport module as m\nfrom module import function\nThe first way of importing will make the module a function comes from more explicitly clear, and is the simplest. However for very long module names, or ones that are used very frequently (like pandas, numpy, and matplotlib.plot), the code in the notebook will be more cluttered with constant calls to longer module names. So module.function() instead is written as m.function()\nThe second way of importing a module is a good style to use in cases where modules are used frequently, or have extremely long names. If you import every single module with a short name, however, you might have a hard time remembering which modules are named what, and it might be more confusing for others trying to read your code. Many of the most commonly used libraries for python data science have community-driven styling for how they are abbreviated in import statements, and these community norms are generally best followed.\nFinally, the last way to import a single object from a module can be helpful if you only need that one piece from a larger module, but again, like the first case, results in less explicit code and therefore runs the risk of your or someone else misremembering the usage and source.\n\n\n3.6.2 Read in a csv\nCreate a new code chunk that will download the csv that we are going to use for this tutorial.\n\nNavigate to Rohi Muthyala, Åsa Rennermalm, Sasha Leidman, Matthew Cooper, Sarah Cooley, et al. 2022. 62 days of Supraglacial streamflow from June-August, 2016 over southwest Greenland.

But at times, computations can be:\n\ncpu-bound: Take too much cpu time\nmemory-bound: Take too much memory\nI/O-bound: Take too much time to read/write from disk\nnetwork-bound: Take too much time to transfer\n\nTo help with cpu-bound computations, one can take advantage of modern processor architectures that provide multiple cores on a single processor, and thereby enable multiple computations to take place at the same time. In addition, some machines ship with multiple processors, allowing large computations to occur across the entire cluster of those computers. Plus, these machines also have large amounts of memory to avoid memory-bound computing jobs."

    "text": "4.4 Processors (CPUs) and Cores\nA modern CPU (Central Processing Unit) is at the heart of every computer. While traditional computers had a single CPU, modern computers can ship with mutliple processors, which in turn can each contain multiple cores. These processors and cores are available to perform computations.\nA computer with one processor may still have 4 cores (quad-core), allowing 4 computations to be executed at the same time.\n\nA typical modern computer has multiple cores, ranging from one or two in laptops to thousands in high performance compute clusters. Here we show four quad-core processors for a total of 16 cores in this machine.\n\nYou can think of this as allowing 16 computations to happen at the same time. Theroetically, your computation would take 1/16 of the time (but only theoretically, more on that later).\nHistorically, R has only utilized one processor, which makes it single-threaded. Which is a shame, because the 2017 MacBook Pro that I am writing this on is much more powerful than that:\n{bash eval=FALSE} jones@powder:~$ sysctl hw.ncpu hw.physicalcpu hw.ncpu: 8 hw.physicalcpu: 4\nTo interpret that output, this machine powder has 4 physical CPUs, each of which has two processing cores, for a total of 8 cores for computation. I’d sure like my R computations to use all of that processing power. Because its all on one machine, we can easily use multicore processing tools to make use of those cores. Now let’s look at the computational server aurora at NCEAS:\n{bash eval=FALSE} jones@included-crab:~$ lscpu | egrep 'CPU\\(s\\)|per core|per socket' CPU(s):                88 On-line CPU(s) list:   0-87 Thread(s) per core:    2 Core(s) per socket:    22 NUMA node0 CPU(s):     0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34,36,38,40,42,44,46,48,50,52,54,56,58,60,62,64,66,68,70,72,74,76,78,80,82,84,86 NUMA node1 CPU(s):     1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17,19,21,23,25,27,29,31,33,35,37,39,41,43,45,47,49,51,53,55,57,59,61,63,65,67,69,71,73,75,77,79,81,83,85,87\nNow that’s more compute power! included-crab has 384 GB of RAM, and ample storage. All still under the control of a single operating system.\nHowever, maybe one of these NSF-sponsored high performance computing clusters (HPC) is looking attractive about now:\n\nJetStream\n\n640 nodes, 15,360 cores, 80TB RAM\n\nStampede2 at TACC is coming online in 2017\n\n4200 nodes, 285,600 cores\n\nTODO: update with modern cluster sizes\n\nNote that these clusters have multiple nodes (hosts), and each host has multiple cores. So this is really multiple computers clustered together to act in a coordinated fashion, but each node runs its own copy of the operating system, and is in many ways independent of the other nodes in the cluster. One way to use such a cluster would be to use just one of the nodes, and use a multi-core approach to parallelization to use all of the cores on that single machine. But to truly make use of the whole cluster, one must use parallelization tools that let us spread out our computations across multiple host nodes in the cluster."

If each task is completely independent of the others, then it is a prime candidate for executing those tasks in parallel, each on its own core. For example, let’s build a simple loop that downloads the data files that we need for an analysis. First, we start with the serial implementation.\n\n# Use loop for serial execution of tasks\n\n# Tasks are to download data from a dataset\n\nThe issue with this loop is that we execute each trial sequentially, which means that only one of our 8 processors on this machine are in use. In order to exploit parallelism, we need to be able to dispatch our tasks as functions, with one task going to each processor. To do that, we need to convert our task to a function, and then use the map() function to apply that function to all of the members of a set. Here’s the same code rewritten to use map(), which applies a function to each of the members of a list (in this case the files we want to download):\n\n# Use `map` for serial execution of tasks\n\n# Tasks are to download data from a dataset"

    "text": "4.10 When to parallelize\nIt’s not as simple as it may seem. While in theory each added processor would linearly increase the throughput of a computation, there is overhead that reduces that efficiency. For example, the code and, importantly, the data need to be copied to each additional CPU, and this takes time and bandwidth. Plus, new processes and/or threads need to be created by the operating system, which also takes time. This overhead reduces the efficiency enough that realistic performance gains are much less than theoretical, and usually do not scale linearly as a function of processing power. For example, if the time that a computation takes is short, then the overhead of setting up these additional resources may actually overwhelm any advantages of the additional processing power, and the computation could potentially take longer!\nIn addition, not all of a task can be parallelized. Depending on the proportion, the expected speedup can be significantly reduced. Some propose that this may follow Amdahl’s Law, where the speedup of the computation (y-axis) is a function of both the number of cores (x-axis) and the proportion of the computation that can be parallelized (see colored lines):\n#| eval: false\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\namdahl <- function(p, s) {\n  return(1 / ( (1-p) + p/s  ))\n}\ndoubles <- 2^(seq(0,16))\ncpu_perf <- cbind(cpus = doubles, p50 = amdahl(.5, doubles))\ncpu_perf <- cbind(cpu_perf, p75 = amdahl(.75, doubles))\ncpu_perf <- cbind(cpu_perf, p85 = amdahl(.85, doubles))\ncpu_perf <- cbind(cpu_perf, p90 = amdahl(.90, doubles))\ncpu_perf <- cbind(cpu_perf, p95 = amdahl(.95, doubles))\n#cpu_perf <- cbind(cpu_perf, p99 = amdahl(.99, doubles))\ncpu_perf <- as.data.frame(cpu_perf)\ncpu_perf <- cpu_perf %>% gather(prop, speedup, -cpus)\nggplot(cpu_perf, aes(cpus, speedup, color=prop)) + \n  geom_line() +\n  scale_x_continuous(trans='log2') +\n  theme_bw() +\n  labs(title = \"Amdahl's Law\")\nSo, its important to evaluate the computational efficiency of requests, and work to ensure that additional compute resources brought to bear will pay off in terms of increased work being done. With that, let’s do some parallel computing…"

Next, we reviewed the way in which traditional for loops in R can be rewritten as functions that are applied to a list serially using lapply, and then how the parallel package mclapply function can be substituted in order to utilize multiple cores on the local computer to speed up computations. Finally, we installed and reviewed the use of the foreach package with the %dopar operator to accomplish a similar parallelization using multiple cores."

    "text": "8.2 Introduction\nThe Permafrost Discovery Gateway is an online platform for archiving, processing, analysis, and visualization of permafrost big imagery products to enable discovery and knowledge-generation. The PDG utilizes and makes available products derived from high resolution satellite imagrey from the Polar Geospatial Center, Planet (3m), Sentinel (10 m), Landsat (30 m), and MODIS (250 m). One of these products is a dataset showing Ice Wedge Polygons (IWP) that form in melting permafrost.\nIce wedges form as a result of thermal contraction during melt/freeze cycles of permafrost. They can form very distinctive geometries clearly visible in satellite images. The PDG is using advanced analysis and computational tools to take high resolution satellite imagery and automatically dectect where ice wedge polygons form. Below is an example of a satellite image (left) and the detected ice wedge polygons in geospatial vector format (right) of that same image.\n\nIn the group project, we are going to use a subset of the high resolution dataset of these detected ice wedge polygons in order to learn some of the reproducible, scalable techniques that will allow us to process it. Our workflow will start with a set of large geopackage files that contain the detected ice wedge polygons. These files all have irregular extents due to the variation in satellite coverage, clouds, etc. Our first processing step will take these files and “tile” them into smaller files which have regular extents.\n\nIn step two of the workflow, we will take those regularly tiled geopackage files and rasterize them. The files will be regularly gridded, and a summary statistic will be calculated for each grid cell (such as the proportion of pixel area covered by polygons).\n\nIn the final step of the workflow, we will take the raster files and resample them to create a set of raster tiles at different resolutions. This last step is what will enable us to visualize our raster data dynamically, such that we look at lower resolutions when very zoomed out (and high resolution data would take too long to load), and higher resolution data when zoomed in and the extent is smaller."

This workbook will serve as a skeleton for you to work in. It will load in all the libraries you need, including a few helper functions we wrote for the course, show an example for how to use the method on one file, and then lays out blocks for you and your group to fill in with code that will run that method in parallel.\nIn your small groups, work together to write the solution, but everyone should aim to have a working solution on their own fork of the repository. In other words, everyone should type out the solution themselves as part of the group effort. Writing the code out yourself (even if others are contributing to the content) is a great way to get “mileage” as you develop these skills."

    "text": "10.3 Row major vs column major\nThe difference between row major and column major is the ordering of the objects.\nTake the array:\na11 a12 a13\n\na21 a22 a23\nThis array in a row-major order would be read in as:\na11, a12, a13, a21, a22, a23\nYou could also read it in column-major order as:\na11, a21, a12, a22, a13, a33\nBy default, C and SAS use row major order for arrays, and column major is used by Fortran, MATLAB, R, and Julia.\nPython uses neither, instead representing arrays as lists of lists, though numpy uses row-major order.\n\n10.3.1 File formats\nThe same concept can be applied to file formats as the example with arrays above. In row-major file formats, the values (bytes) of each record are read sequentially.\n\n\n\nName\nLocation\nAge\n\n\n\n\nJohn\nWashington\n40\n\n\nMariah\nTexas\n21\n\n\nAllison\nOregon\n57\n\n\n\nIn the above row major example, data are read in the order: John, Washingon, 40, [new line], Mariah, Texas, 21.\nThis means that getting a subset of all columns would be easy; you can specify to read in only the first X rows. However, if we are only interested in Name and Location, we would still have to read in all of the rows before discarding the Age column.\nIf these data were organized in a column major format, they might look like this:\nName: John, Mariah, Allison\nLocation: Washington, Texas, Oregon\nAge: 40, 21, 57\nAnd the read order would first be the names, then the locations, then the age. This means that selecting all values from a set of columns is quite easy (all of the Names and Ages, or all Names and Locations), but reading in only the first few records from each column would require reading in the entire dataset. Another advantage to column major formats is that compression is more efficient since compression can be done across each column, where the data type is uniform, as opposed to across rows with many data types."

The Arrow project provides implementation of this specification in a number of languages, including Python.\nLet’s say that you have utilized the Parquet data format for more efficient storage of your data on disk. At some point, you’ll need to read that data into memory in order to do analysis on it. Arrow enables data transfer between the on disk Parquet files and in-memory Python computations, via the PyArrow library.\nPyArrow is great, but relatively low level. It supports basic group by and aggregate functions, as well as table and dataset joins, but it does not support the full operations that pandas does."

The following code displays an empty Google Map that you can manipulate just like you would in the typical Google Maps interface. Do this using the Map method from the geemap library. We’ll also center the map at a specified latitude and longitude (here, 40N, 100E), set a zoom level, and save our map as an object called myMap.\n\nmyMap = geemap.Map(center = [40, -100], zoom = 2)\nmyMap\n\n\nLoad ERA5 Image Collections from GEE\n\n\nNOTE: ADC has worked with these data – took 3 weeks to download\nEE colleciton is all you need to load and analyze imgage collection\nprecursor to Ingmar’s stuff\n\nWe’ll be using the ERA5 daily aggregates reanalysis dataset, produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), found here, which models atmospheric weather observations. We’ll load the total_precipitation field (check out the dataset metadata on here).\nThe ImageCollection method extracts a set of individual images that satisfies some criterion that you pass to GEE through the ee package. This is stored as an ImageCollection object which can be filtered and processed in various ways. We can pass the ImageCollction method agruments to tell GEE which data we want to retrieve. Below, we retrieve all daily ERA5 data (so we can see individual rain events).\n\nweatherData = ee.ImageCollection('ECMWF/ERA5/DAILY')\n\n\nSelect an image to plot\n\nTo plot a map over our Google Maps basemap, we need an “Image” rather than an “ImageCollection.” ERA5 contains many different climate variables, so we need to pick what we’d like to plot. We’ll use the .select method to choose the parameter(s) we’re interested in from our weatherData object.\n\nprecip = weatherData.select(\"total_precipitation\")\n\nWe can look at our precip object using the print method to see that it’s still an “ImageCollection” which contains daily infomration from 1979 to 2020.\n\nprint(precip)\n\nWe want to filter it down to a single field for a time of interest – let’s say December 1-2, 2019. We apply the .filter method to our precip object and apply the ee.Filter.date method (from the ee package) to filter for data from our chosen date range. We also apply the .mean method, which takes whatever precedes it and calculates the average.\n\nprecip_filtered = precip.filter(ee.Filter.date('2019-12-01', '2019-12-02')).mean()\n\n\nAdd data to map\n\nWe can fist use the setCenter method to tell the map where to center itself. It takes the longitude and latitude as the first two coordinates, followed by the zoom level.\n\nMap.setCenter(-152.505706, 59.432367, 2) # Cook Inlet, Alaska (WE CAN CHANGE THIS LOCATION)\n\nNext, set a color palette to use when plotting the data layer. The following is a palette specified for precipitation in the GEE description page for ERA5. GEE has lots of color tables like this that you can look up.\n\nprecip_palette = {\n    'min':0,\n    'max':0.1,\n    'palette': ['#FFFFFF', '#00FFFF', '#0080FF', '#DA00FF', '#FFA400', '#FF0000']\n}\n\nFinally, plot our filtered data, precip_filtered on top of our basemap using the .addLayer method. We’ll aslo pass it our visualization parameters (colors and ranges stored in precip_palette, the name of the data field total precipitation, and opacity so that we can see the basemap underneath)\n\nMap.addLayer(precip_filtered, precip_palette, 'total precipitation', opacity = 0.3)"

Use pandas.concat() instead (GH35407).\n\nPrinciples to get across:\n\nYou probably should be thinking about software versioning\n\nKnow which version of versions of Python your code was written/tested under and keep track of that in a machine-readable way\nKnow the specific versions, of at least the specific MAJOR.MINOR of the packages your code was written+tested under and keep track of them in a machine-readable way (ie requirements.txt)"
