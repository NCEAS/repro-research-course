It’s completely okay to say “Pass” or “I Don’t Know” - this is a supportive learning environment and we will all learn from each other. The instructors will be able to see your code as you go to help you if you get stuck, and the lead instructor may share participants’ code to show a successful example or illustrate a teaching moment. 0.1.2 About this book These written materials are the result of a continuous effort at NCEAS to help researchers make their work more transparent and reproducible.
