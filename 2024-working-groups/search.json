The NCEAS approach leverages existing data and employs a team science philosophy to squeeze out all potential insights and solutions efficiently - this is called synthesis science.\nNCEAS has over 25 years of success with this model among working groups and environmental professionals. Together with the Delta Science Program and the Delta Stewardship Council we are excited to pass along skills, workflows, mindsets learn throughout the years.\n\nLearning Objectives\nMAYBE ADD OVER ALL LEARNING OBJECTIVES?\n\n\nWorkshop Schedule\nTABLE WITH ALL DATES\n\n\nHow to register?\nADD INFORMATION",

To achieve reproducibility, it is important to set systems in place and manage data thoroughly. Data management is the process of handling, organizing, documenting, and preserving data used in a project/research. It helps your research outcomes be transparent, maximizing your work’s practical use and value. This lesson provides an overview of all the meaningful steps in a research project and dives into how to plan for successful data management. We will also discuss tools and systems to help you organize and document your work for better reproducibility, to make your analysis robust, and to facilitate collaboration (including with yourself).\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nUnderstand the importance and benefits of data management and data management plans.\nApply the Data Life Cycle steps to organize and plan a research project.\nIntroduce tools and techniques for establishing reproducible analytical workflows.\nDiscuss why we should aim for reproducibility and its importance for collaboration.",
