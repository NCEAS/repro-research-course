    "text": "About the Series\nWe are excited to announce a new NCEAS Training Series specifically designed to help Working Groups collaborate effectively. For new working groups we highly encourage participation in the first three “Working Group Essentials” trainings. These are designed to prepare working groups during the early stages of the collaboration process with tips on facilitation, data management and communications. We also have a series of “Extended Learning” trainings that are open to all working groups and focus on specific skills around data management and communications.\nWe encourage you to review the list of trainings and the attached information sheet and discuss with your team which trainings you are personally interested in as well as which ones you might find beneficial as a group. Space is limited, please register by following the links for each training below. We will also send monthly reminders with information about each training and a registration reminder. All trainings will be held on Zoom, please check out more detailed information about each training here.\nAll training materials will be available in this book after each training.",

To achieve reproducibility, it is important to set systems in place and manage data thoroughly. Data management is the process of handling, organizing, documenting, and preserving data used in a project/research. It helps your research outcomes be transparent, maximizing your work’s practical use and value. This lesson provides an overview of all the meaningful steps in a research project and dives into how to plan for successful data management. We will also discuss tools and systems to help you organize and document your work for better reproducibility, to make your analysis robust, and to facilitate collaboration (including with yourself).\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nUnderstand the importance and benefits of data management and data management plans.\nApply the Data Life Cycle steps to organize and plan a research project.\nIntroduce tools and techniques for establishing reproducible analytical workflows.\nDiscuss why we should aim for reproducibility and its importance for collaboration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissed the training?\n\n\n\nFind the video recording of this workshop in this link.\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\nThe Research Data Management Workbook by Kristin Briney\nData inventory spreadsheet template\nDocumenting Things: Openly for Future Us, by Julia Stewart Lowndes at posit::conf(2023).

There are a number of IDEs out there, but RStudio is arguably the best and definitely most popular among R programmers.\nNote: RStudio will not work without R installed, and you won’t particularly enjoy using R without having RStudio installed.
