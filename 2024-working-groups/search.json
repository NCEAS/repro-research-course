    "text": "About the Series\nWe are excited to announce a new NCEAS Training Series specifically designed to help Working Groups collaborate effectively. For new working groups we highly encourage participation in the first three “Working Group Essentials” trainings. These are designed to prepare working groups during the early stages of the collaboration process with tips on facilitation, data management and communications. We also have a series of “Extended Learning” trainings that are open to all working groups and focus on specific skills around data management and communications.\nWe encourage you to review the list of trainings and the attached information sheet and discuss with your team which trainings you are personally interested in as well as which ones you might find beneficial as a group. Space is limited, please register by following the links for each training below. We will also send monthly reminders with information about each training and a registration reminder. All trainings will be held on Zoom, please check out more detailed information about each training here.\nAll training materials will be available in this book after each training.",

To achieve reproducibility, it is important to set systems in place and manage data thoroughly. Data management is the process of handling, organizing, documenting, and preserving data used in a project/research. It helps your research outcomes be transparent, maximizing your work’s practical use and value. This lesson provides an overview of all the meaningful steps in a research project and dives into how to plan for successful data management. We will also discuss tools and systems to help you organize and document your work for better reproducibility, to make your analysis robust, and to facilitate collaboration (including with yourself).\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nUnderstand the importance and benefits of data management and data management plans.\nApply the Data Life Cycle steps to organize and plan a research project.\nIntroduce tools and techniques for establishing reproducible analytical workflows.\nDiscuss why we should aim for reproducibility and its importance for collaboration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissed the training?\n\n\n\nFind the video recording of this workshop in this link.\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\nThe Research Data Management Workbook by Kristin Briney\nData inventory spreadsheet template\nDocumenting Things: Openly for Future Us, by Julia Stewart Lowndes at posit::conf(2023).

The latest release is version 4.4 (Puppy Cup, released 2024-04-24).\n\n\nInstall or update RStudio\nWhile R is a programming language, RStudio is a software (often referred to as an IDE, Integrated Development Environment) that provides R programmers with a neat, easy-to-use interface for coding in R. There are a number of IDEs out there, but RStudio is arguably the best and definitely most popular among R programmers.\nNote: RStudio will not work without R installed, and you won’t particularly enjoy using R without having RStudio installed. Be sure to install both!\n\n\n\n\n\nImage Credit: Manny Gimond | Accessible at https://mgimond.github.io/ES218/R_vs_RStudio.html\n\n\n\n\n\nNew install: To install RStudio, visit https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/. Download the free (“Open Source Edition”) Desktop version for your operating system. You should install the most up-to-date version available that is supported by your operating system.\nUpdate: If you already have RStudio and need to update: Open RStudio, and under ‘Help’ in the top menu, choose ‘Check for updates.’ If you have the most recent release, it will return ‘No update available. You are running the most recent version of RStudio.’ Otherwise, you should follow the instructions to install an updated version.\nOpen RStudio: If upon opening RStudio you are prompted to install Command Line Tools, do it.\nNote: you may need to install command line tools and XQuartz.\n\nTo install command line tools (if you’re not automatically prompted), run in the Terminal tab in RStudio: xcode-select --install\nVisit xquartz.org to download & install XQuartz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEP 2: Check for git\nYou might already have git on your device, let’s check.\n\nOpen RStudio\nIn the Terminal tab, run the following command:\n\n\nwhich git\n\n\nIf after running that you get something that looks like a file path to git on your computer, then you have git installed.

Here are helpful considerations for choosing a username: happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html.\n\n\n\nSTEP 4: Install R packages\n\nInstall the usethis and gitcreds packages in R by running the following in the RStudio Console:\n\n\ninstall.packages(“usethis”)\n\ninstall.packages(\"gitcreds\")\n\nA lot of scary looking red text will show up while this is installing - don’t panic.
