    "text": "1.1 What is Synthesis Science?\n\n\n\nGraphic by Judith Sitters\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSynthesis Science in Ecological and Environmental Sciences\n\n\n\nSynthesis science is the process of distilling existing data, ideas, theories, or methods drawn from many sources, across multiple fields of inquiry, to accelerate the generation of new scientific knowledge, often at a broad scale.\n\n\nTo break that down further, think of it this way: synthesis science utilizes existing data and knowledge to generate new insights. It’s like putting together puzzle pieces from different sources to create a bigger picture.\nSynthesis science is fundamentally different from other types of academic research in that it does not involve collecting new or original data to conduct research or to answer a research question.\nSince the ecological and environmental sciences are complex and often interdisciplinary, synthesis approaches are ideal for “understanding complexity across scales, leveraging data from various disciplines, facilitating the discovery of general patterns in natural systems, and informing policy” (Halpern et al. 2023) in the ecological and environmental sciences.\n\n1.1.1 The Value and Impact of Synthesis Research\n\n\n\nGraphic adapted from Engingeering Ideas newsletter on Substack\n\n\nData is everywhere and information is more accessible than ever, but how can we leverage both data and knowledge to further our understanding of a topic and turn those insights into meaningful action? This is where synthesis research shines.\nThere are many studies that value the importance of synthesis for varying reasons including:\n\nElevating scientific research as evidence that is influential in policy-making (Dicks, Walsh, and Sutherland 2014)\nAddressing the challenge of “information overload” (Hampton and Parker 2011)\nDelivering research products that enhance scientific knowledge in decision-making (Hampton and Parker 2011)\nProviding critical knowledge to solve environmental issues (Carpenter et al. 2009)\nInitiating new collaborations and new insights across disciplines and non-academic sectors (Hampton and Parker 2011)\n\nAs synthesis science and research synthesis approaches have been gaining prominence in the ecological and environmental fields, researchers have sought to understand the impacts of synthesis. In particular, Wyborn et al. (2018) identified the following types of impacts from research synthesis:\n\nKnowledge is used to change understanding of a system or phenomena\nKnowledge changes understanding of the interconnections between actors, sectors or systems\nKnowledge is used to support a particular view of a problem\nKnowledge is used as the prime source of information to inform policy change or reform\nKnowledge use is dependent on the capacity to understand or apply knowledge in a given context",

    "text": "1.2 Research Synthesis Approaches\nIn general, research synthesis approaches include utilizing existing research on a particular topic with the intention of integrating all the findings together.\nThere are multiple different types of approaches such as narrative reviews, vote counting (this quantitative method has been discredited, but you may find examples of it in your research), case studies, and more. However, systematic reviews and meta-analysis are considered by some to be the “gold standard” of research synthesis and are often used at NCEAS, which is why we’re highlighting them here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSystematic Review\nA form of synthesis to study a specific question or problem by following clear steps: finding and choosing studies, checking them carefully, and gathering information from them to create a reliable review.\nNote: Not all systematic reviews contain meta-analysis\n\n\nMeta-Analysis\nA form of synthesis that uses statistical and quantitative methods to integrate and compare (quantitatively) results from a large number of individual studies.\n\n\n\n\n1.2.1 What about data?\nData is essential to synthesis in ecological and environmental research. Synthesizing data can involve combining and analyzing data from multiple sources to address research questions, to conduct a systematic review or meta-analysis, to identify patterns, and draw meaningful conclusions that don’t appear in siloed approaches.\nAt NCEAS, our approach tends to include combining multiple datasets from various sources, then we leverage specific expertise from diverse disciplines and researchers, and together we use those two elements to unleash new insights to answer large-scale questions.\nWe often see this approach with working groups at NCEAS. Working groups are teams that include researchers, agencies and organizational practitioners, and more who come together (and typically at NCEAS, a neutral ground) for focused and intensive working sessions around their research questions.",

Since its inception, NCEAS has hosted hundreds of working groups and has supported them in varying ways including: structuring group size or composition, facilitating of working sessions, supplying computing and informatics support, offering training opportunities for data-focused team members, providing a neutral space for meetings and co-working, and more. In short, NCEAS lowers the “activation energy” for working group members so that they can focus on the cross-pollination of ideas, creative thinking, and emergent research (Rodrigo et al. 2013).",

    "section": "1.5 Priorities of Synthesis Here, Now, and Beyond",
    "text": "1.5 Priorities of Synthesis Here, Now, and Beyond\nIn February 2021, NCEAS hosted a virtual workshop where 127 ecologists, environmental and natural scientists convened to discuss the future priorities of synthesis science. Participants across career stages, institutions, backgrounds, and geographies were in attendance and together they identified seven research topics, and two pressing needs for conducting research synthesis practices.\nLater in January 2023, dozens of scientists authored and published Priorities for synthesis research in ecology and environmental science the results of the workshop. We’ve summarized these results in the tables below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Topic\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nDiversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Justice (DEIJ)\nEnvironmental justice shows the link between nature and fairness for people, especially those who are disadvantaged. Unequal distribution of nature due to factors like racism impacts cities and ecosystems. Integrating DEIJ into research can improve knowledge and involve underrepresented groups, while engaging diverse communities can make research more impactful and inclusive.\n\n\nHuman and Natural systems\nEnvironmental synthesis has given us valuable insights into environmental change, but it needs to also look at how human actions and decisions affect the environment. For example, decisions about things like population growth and greenhouse gas policies impact species and nature. Bringing together information from different fields is challenging, especially when considering different scales and practices. Synthesis science can help us better understand how humans and nature are connected, but it takes time and effort to combine ideas from different disciplines.\n\n\nActionable and Use-inspired science\nSynthesis science in ecology and environmental science is great for helping decision makers. Methods like systematic reviews and predictive models can simplify research for environmental policy. To be more effective, scientists need to work closely with practitioners and use different types of knowledge. Communication, teamwork, and using various knowledge sources can improve how decisions are made and carried out based on scientific findings.\n\n\nScale\nUnderstanding ecosystems across different sizes and time periods is hard for social-ecological research. Synthesis helps by combining information and methods from different scales, and connecting these findings to policy decisions. The challenges come from not having enough long-term data, difficulty mixing different information for analysis, and lack of skills and cooperation across scales. To overcome these challenges, more efforts are needed to collect, organize, and combine data over long periods and big areas.\n\n\nGenerality\nScience looks for common rules to explain how things work, but sometimes it’s hard to find them. Synthesis science can help find these general rules and figure out when they apply. Two problems are not having enough similar studies to compare and bias in what gets studied and reported. To fix this, scientists can share their work openly, use the same rules for reporting, and make sure all types of results are published. Working together across different areas can also help find these general rules.\n\n\nComplexity and Resilience\nEcosystems are very complicated, especially when considering things like society and economics. This complexity can make systems strong or weak. Using this complex view helps solve problems like water and food. But putting all this information together (synthesis) is hard because it depends on the situation, and finding general rules is tough. To make it work better, more scientists need to learn to work together across different areas and share their data. The goal is to understand how complexity affects ecosystems and find ways to help both people and the environment.\n\n\nPredictability\nThis time of big changes in the environment makes it important to predict how ecosystems will be in the future and how they’ll affect people. Predicting things in the short term (like months or years) is common in some fields but not in ecology. Some people worry that the predictions might not be perfect, but even imperfect predictions can help us learn and make better decisions. To make predictions better in ecology, scientists can work together, use standardized methods and data, and talk to the people who use the predictions. This will help us manage natural resources more wisely.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPressing Need\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nNeed for increased participant diversity and inclusive research practices\nSynthesis science is most effective when it combines data, perspectives, and insights from different regions and ecosystems. By including diverse participants and creating inclusive research environments, we can better address important questions and find fair solutions to challenges. Ignoring diversity and inclusion can lead to biased syntheses and unfair outcomes. The large scope of synthesis science calls for involving people, ideas, and data from various backgrounds and languages. Efforts should be made to ensure representation, provide support, and promote open dialogue to increase diversity and inclusivity in synthesis research, ultimately fostering better understanding and more equitable outcomes.\n\n\nIncreased and improved data flow, access, and skill-building\nThe amount of data for synthesis science is increasing, and there are efforts to organize and combine data from various sources to answer ecological questions. Funding is needed to manage and store data properly. It’s important to think about ethical issues when using different datasets, especially if some people can’t share their data openly. Some data may be hard to access due to language or quality issues, and including diverse types of data, like traditional knowledge, can be challenging. Tools like machine learning can help make sense of different data sources. To improve data synthesis, global collaboration among diverse groups is essential.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarpenter, Stephen R., E.

    "text": "2.1 Logic Models\nLogic models are a planning tool that is designed to support program development by depicting the flow of resources and processes leading to a desired result. They are also used for outcomes-based evaluation of a program and are often requested as part of an evaluation planning process by funders or stakeholders.\nA simplified logic models comprise three main parts: Inputs, Outputs and Outcomes.\n\nInputs reflect what is invested, outputs are what is done and outcomes are the results of the program.\nIn a more detailed logic model, outputs and outcomes are further broken down. Outputs are often represented as ‘Activities’ and ‘Participants’. By including participation (or participants), the logic model is explicitly considering the intended audience, or stakeholders, impacted by the program. Engagement of this audience is an output. In the case of outcomes, these can be split into short, medium and long-term outcomes. Sometimes this last category may be labeled ‘Impact’\n\nDefining the inputs, outputs and outcomes early in a planning process enables teams to visualize the workflow from activity to results and can help mitigate potential challenges. Logic models can be thought of as having an ‘if this then that’ structure where inputs -&gt; outputs -&gt; outcomes.\n\nIn the example below we have constructed a simple logic model for a hypothetical project where training materials are being developed for a group of educators to implement at their respective institutions.\n\nLinkages are not always sequential and can be within categories, bi-directional and/or include feedback loops. Detailing this complexity of relationships, or theory of action, can be time-consuming but is a valuable part of the thought process for project planning. In exploring all relationships, logic modeling also allows for assessing program feasibility.\n\nThe above graphics include two sections within Outputs - Activities and Participants - and this is quite common. There is variation in logic model templates, including versions with a third type of output - “Products’. Sometimes description of these products is contained within the Activities section - for example, ‘develop curricula’, ‘produce a report’ - however calling these out explicitly is beneficial for teams focused on product development.\nProgram development (and logic modeling) occurs in response to a given ‘Situation’ or need, and exploring this is the first step in modeling. The situation defines the objective, or problem, that the program is designed to solve hence some logic models may omit the left-hand situation column but be framed with Problem and Solution statements. Finally, comprehensive logic modeling takes into consideration assumptions that are made with respect to the resources available, the people involved, or the way the program will work and also recognizes that there are external factors that can impact the program’s success.\n\nIn summary:\nLogic models support program development and evaluation and comprise three primary steps in the workflow:\n\nInputs: Resources, contributions, and investments required for a program;\nOutputs: Activities conducted, participants reached, and products produced; and\nOutcomes: Results or expected changes arising from the program structured as short-, medium- and long-term.",

    "section": "3.4 Data Management Plans",
    "text": "3.4 Data Management Plans\nAs you can see there is a lot happening around the Data Life Cycle. This is why PLANNING is a key first step. It is advisable to initiate your data management planning at the beginning of your research process before any data has been collected or discovered.\nIn order to better plan and keep track of all the moving pieces when working with data, a good place to start is creating a Data Management Plan. However, this is not only the starting point. This is a “living” document that should be consulted and updated throughout the project.\nA Data Management Plan (DMP) is a document that describes how you will use your data during a research project, as well as what you will do with your data long after the project ends. DMPs should be updated as research plans change to ensure new data management practices are captured (Environmental Data Initiative).\nA well-thought-out plan means you are more likely to:\n\nstay organized\nwork efficiently\ntruly share data\nengage your team\nmeet funder requirements as DMPs are becoming common in the submission process for proposals\n\nA DMP is both a straightforward blueprint for how you manage your data, and provides guidelines for you and your team on policies, roles and responsibilities. While it is important to plan, it is equally important to recognize that no plan is perfect, as change is inevitable. To make your DMP as robust as possible, review it periodically with your team and adjust as the needs of the project change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to plan\n\n\n\n\nPlan early - information gets lost over time. Think about your data needs as you are starting your project.\nPlan in collaboration - engaging all the team makes your plan more resilient, including diverse expertise and perspectives.\nMake revision part of the process - adapt as needed, revising your plan helps you make sure your are on track.\nInclude a tidy data and data ethic lens \n\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1 Creating a Good Data management Plan\nThe article Ten Simple Rules for Creating a Good Data Management Plan (Michener (2015)) outlines big picture ideas to keep in mind when you start your “planning stage”. Here we summarize each point and provide useful resources or examples to help you achieve this “rules” and write an awesome DMP.\n\n3.4.1.1 Determine what are the organization and/or sponsor requirements\n\nGenerally, each organization or funding agency have specific expectations on how to manage and disseminate data. Even though a DMP is a good idea to keep you organize. It will save you significant time and effort by first understanding the specific requirements set by the organization you are working for. Each organization often provide templates on how to structure your DMP.\nResources\n\nThe DMPTool provides templates for different funding agencies plan requirements.\nUSGS has multiple resources on DMPs. Here the Data Policy and Guidance for the Climate Adaptation Science Centers\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1.2 Identify the desired/necessary data sets for the project\n\nData is the ultimate reason why we create a DMP. Identifying what data will be use is crucial to planning. Key aspects of the data to consider are:\n\nType (text, spatial, images, tabular, etc)\nSource (where does the data currently live?, is it proprietary data?)\nVolume (10 terabytes, 10 megabytes?)\nFormat (csv, xlsx, shapefiles, etc)\n\nResource\n\nHere is a template spreadsheet to collect all information about the data set you intent to use for your synthesis project. Please make a copy and adapt as needed.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1.3 Define how the data will be organized\n\nOnce you know the data you will be using (rule #2) it is time to define how are you going to work with your data. Where will the raw data live? How are the different collaborators going to access the data? The needs vary widely from one project to another depending on the data. When drafting your DMP is helpful to focus on identifying what products and software you will be using. When collaborating with a team it is important to identify f there are any limitations to accessing any software or tool.\nResource\n\nHere is an example from the LTER Scientific Computing Support Team on working on NCEAS Server.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1.4 Explain how the data will be documented\n\nWe know documenting data is very important. To successfully achieve this we need a plan in place. Three main steps to plan accordingly are:\n\nIdentifying the type of information you want/need to collect to document your data thoroughly\nDetermine if the is a metadata standard or schema (organized set of elements) you will follow (eg. EML, Dublin Core, ISO 19115, ect). In many cases this relates with what data repository you intend to archive your data.\nEstablish tools that can help you create and manage metadata content.\n\nResource\n\nExcel-to EML by Li Kui is a workflow that provides a spreadsheet template to collect metadata based on the Ecological Metadata Language Schema (EML)\nThe Environmental Data Repository (EDI) providees a tool called ezEML. A form-based web application that helps streamline the process of creating EML metadata.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1.5 Describe how data quality will be assured\n\nQuality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) are the procedures taken to ensure data looks how we expect it to be. The ultimate goal is to improve the quality of the data products. Some fields of study, data types or funding organizations have specific set of guidelines for QA/QCing data. However, when writing your DMP it is important to describe what measures you plan to take to QA/QC the data (e.g: instrument calibration, verification tests, visualization approaches for error detection, etc.)\nResources\n\nEnvironmental Data Initiative (EDI) description and examples of Quality Assurance and Quality Control\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1.6 Have a data storage strategy (short and long term)\n\nPapers get lost, hardware disk crash, URLs break, different media format degrade. It’s inevitable! Plan ahead and think on where your data will live in the short and long-term to ensure the access and use of this data during and long after the project. It is important to have a backup mechanism in place during the project to avoid losing any information.\nResource\n\nRemote locations to store your data during your project are: institutional repositories or servers or commercial services such as Amazon, Dropbox, Google, Microsoft, Box, etc.\nLong-term storage: identify an appropriate and stable data repository for your research domain (See section 3.6 Data Preservation and Sharing)\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1.7 Define the project’s data policies\n\nMany organizations and institutions require to include an explicit policy statement about how data will be managed and shared. Including licensing or sharing arrangements and legal and ethical restrictions on access and use of human subject and other sensitive data. It is valuable to establish a shared agreement around handling of data when embarking on collaborative projects. Collaborative research brings together data from across research projects with different data management plans and can include publicly accessible data from repositories where no management plan is available. For these reasons, a discussion and agreement around the handling of data brought into and resulting from the collaboration is warranted, and management of this new data may benefit from going through a data management planning process.\nResource\n\nTemplate provided by the Arctic Data Center, including sections for individual data not in the public domain, individual data with public access, derived data resulting from the project.\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1.8 What data products will be made available and how?\n\nThis portion of the DMP tries to ensure that the data products of your project will be disseminated. This can be achieved by stating how, when and where these products will be available. We encourage open data practices, this means making data extensively available and with the least restrictions possible.\nExamples\n\nPublishing the data in an open repository or archive\nSubmitting the data (or subsets thereof) as appendices or supplements to journal articles\nPublishing the data, metadata, and relevant code as a “data paper”\n\n\n\n\n3.4.1.9 Assign roles and responsibilities\n\nIt is important to clearly determine the roles and responsibilities of each group member of the project. Roles may include data collection, data entry, QA/QC, metadata creation and management, backup, data preparation and submission to an archive, and systems administration.\n\n\n\n3.4.1.10 Prepare a realistic budget\n\nGenerally overlooked, but preparing a realistic budget it’s an important part when planning for your data management. Data management takes time and it may have cost associates to it for example access to software, hardware, and personnel. Make sure you plan considers budget to support people involved as well as software or data fees or other services as needed.",

    "section": "3.5 Metadata Best Practices",
    "text": "3.5 Metadata Best Practices\nWithin the data life cycle you can be collecting data (creating new data) or integrating data that has all ready been collected. Either way, metadata plays plays a major role to successfully spin around the cycle because it enables data reuse long after the original collection.\nImagine that you’re writing your metadata for a typical researcher (who might even be you!) 30+ years from now - what will they need to understand what’s inside your data files?\nThe goal is to have enough information for the researcher to understand the data, interpret the data, and then reuse the data in another study.\n\n3.5.1 Overall Guidelines\nAnother way to think about metadata is to answer the following questions with the documentation:\n\nWhat was measured?\nWho measured it?\nWhen was it measured?\nWhere was it measured?\nHow was it measured?\nHow is the data structured?\nWhy was the data collected?\nWho should get credit for this data (researcher AND funding agency)?\nHow can this data be reused (licensing)?\n\n\n\n3.5.2 Bibliographic Guidelines\nThe details that will help your data be cited correctly are:\n\nGlobal identifier like a digital object identifier (DOI)\nDescriptive title that includes information about the topic, the geographic location, the dates, and if applicable, the scale of the data\nDescriptive abstract that serves as a brief overview off the specific contents and purpose of the data package\nFunding information like the award number and the sponsor\nPeople and organizations like the creator of the dataset (i.e. who should be cited), the person to contact about the dataset (if different than the creator), and the contributors to the dataset\n\n\n\n3.5.3 Discovery Guidelines\nThe details that will help your data be discovered correctly are:\n\nGeospatial coverage of the data, including the field and laboratory sampling locations, place names and precise coordinates\nTemporal coverage of the data, including when the measurements were made and what time period (ie the calendar time or the geologic time) the measurements apply to\nTaxonomic coverage of the data, including what species were measured and what taxonomy standards and procedures were followed\nAny other contextual information as needed\n\n\n\n3.5.4 Interpretation Guidelines\nThe details that will help your data be interpreted correctly are:\n\nCollection methods for both field and laboratory data the full experimental and project design as well as how the data in the dataset fits into the overall project\nProcessing methods for both field and laboratory samples\nAll sample quality control procedures\nProvenance information to support your analysis and modelling methods\nInformation about the hardware and software used to process your data, including the make, model, and version\nComputing quality control procedures like testing or code review\n\n\n\n3.5.5 Data Structure and Contents\n\nEverything needs a description: the data model, the data objects (like tables, images, matrices, spatial layers, etc), and the variables all need to be described so that there is no room for misinterpretation.\nVariable information includes the definition of a variable, a standardized unit of measurement, definitions of any coded values (i.e. 0 = not collected), and any missing values (i.e. 999 = NA).\n\nNot only is this information helpful to you and any other researcher in the future using your data, but it is also helpful to search engines. The semantics of your dataset are crucial to ensure your data is both discoverable by others and interoperable (that is, reusable).\nFor example, if you were to search for the character string “carbon dioxide flux” in a data repository, not all relevant results will be shown due to varying vocabulary conventions (i.e., “CO2 flux” instead of “carbon dioxide flux”) across disciplines — only datasets containing the exact words “carbon dioxide flux” are returned. With correct semantic annotation of the variables, your dataset that includes information about carbon dioxide flux but that calls it CO2 flux WOULD be included in that search.\n\n\n3.5.6 Rights and Attribution\nCorrectly assigning a way for your datasets to be cited and reused is the last piece of a complete metadata document. This section sets the scientific rights and expectations for the future on your data, like:\n\nCitation format to be used when giving credit for the data\nAttribution expectations for the dataset\nReuse rights, which describe who may use the data and for what purpose\nRedistribution rights, which describe who may copy and redistribute the metadata and the data\nLegal terms and conditions like how the data are licensed for reuse.\n\n\n\n3.5.7 Metadata Standards\nSo, how does a computer organize all this information? There are a number of metadata standards that make your metadata machine readable and therefore easier for data curators to publish your data.\n\nEcological Metadata Language (EML)\nGeospatial Metadata Standards (ISO 19115 and ISO 19139)\n\nSee NOAA’s ISO Workbook\n\nBiological Data Profile (BDP)\nDublin Core\nDarwin Core\nPREservation Metadata: Implementation Strategies (PREMIS)\nMetadata Encoding Transmission Standard (METS)\n\nNote this is not an exhaustive list.\n\n\n3.5.8 Data Identifiers\nMany journals require a DOI (a digital object identifier) be assigned to the published data before the paper can be accepted for publication. The reason for that is so that the data can easily be found and easily linked to.\nSome data repositories assign a DOI for each dataset you publish on their repository. But, if you need to update the datasets, check the policy of the data repository. Some repositories assign a new DOI after you update the dataset. If this is the case, researchers should cite the exact version of the dataset that they used in their analysis, even if there is a newer version of the dataset available.\n\n\n3.5.9 Data Citation\nResearchers should get in the habit of citing the data that they use (even if it’s their own data!) in each publication that uses that data.",

    "text": "3.6 Data Preservation & Sharing\n\n\n3.6.1 Data Packages\n\nWe define a data package as a scientifically useful collection of data and metadata that a researcher wants to preserve.\n\nSometimes a data package represents all of the data from a particular experiment, while at other times it might be all of the data from a grant, or on a topic, or associated with a paper. Whatever the extent, we define a data package as having one or more data files, software files, and other scientific products such as graphs and images, all tied together with a descriptive metadata document.\nMany data repositories assign a unique identifier to every version of every data file, similarly to how it works with source code commits in GitHub. Those identifiers usually take one of two forms. A DOI identifier, often assigned to the metadata and becomes a publicly citable identifier for the package. Each of the other files gets a global identifier, often a UUID that is globally unique. This allows to identify a digital entity within a data package.\nIn the graphic to the side, the package can be cited with the DOI doi:10.5063/F1Z1899CZ,and each of the individual files have their own identifiers as well.\n\n\n\n3.6.2 Data Repositories: Built for Data (and code)\n\nGitHub is not an archival location\nExamples of dedicated data repositories:\n\nKNB\nArctic Data Center\ntDAR\nEDI\nZenodo\n\nDedicated data repositories are:\n\nRich in metadata\nArchival in their mission\nCertified\n\nData papers, e.g., Scientific Data\nre3data is a global registry of research data repositories\nRepository Finder is a pilot project and tool to help researchers find an appropriate repository for their work\n\n\n3.6.2.1 DataOne Federation\nDataONE is a federation of dozens of data repositories that work together to make their systems interoperable and to provide a single unified search system that spans the repositories. DataONE aims to make it simpler for researchers to publish data to one of its member repositories, and then to discover and download that data for reuse in synthetic analyses.\nDataONE can be searched on the web, which effectively allows a single search to find data from the dozens of members of DataONE, rather than visiting each of the (currently 44!) repositories one at a time.",

There are a number of IDEs out there, but RStudio is arguably the best and definitely most popular among R programmers.\nNote: RStudio will not work without R installed, and you won’t particularly enjoy using R without having RStudio installed.

Download the free (“Open Source Edition”) Desktop version for your operating system. You should install the most up-to-date version available that is supported by your operating system.\nUpdate: If you already have RStudio and need to update: Open RStudio, and under ‘Help’ in the top menu, choose ‘Check for updates.’ If you have the most recent release, it will return ‘No update available. You are running the most recent version of RStudio.’ Otherwise, you should follow the instructions to install an updated version.\nOpen RStudio (logo you’ll click on shown below): If upon opening RStudio you are prompted to install Command Line Tools, do it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: you may need to install command line tools and XQuartz.\n\nTo install command line tools (if you’re not automatically prompted), run in the Terminal tab in RStudio: xcode-select --install\nVisit xquartz.org to download & install XQuartz\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Install Quarto\nQuarto is a scientific publishing tool built on Pandoc that allows R, Python, Julia, and ObservableJS users to create dynamic documents, websites, books and more.\nQuarto is now included with RStudio v2022.07.1+ so no need for a separate download/install if you have the latest version of RStudio! You can find all releases (current, pre, and older releases) on the Quarto website download page, should you want/need to reference them.\n\n\n4.1.4 Check for git\nYou should already have git on your device, but let’s check for it anyway.\n\nOpen RStudio\nIn the Terminal, run the following command:\n\n\nwhich git\n\n\nIf after running that you get something that looks like a file path to git on your computer, then you have git installed. For example, that might return something like this (or it could differ a bit): /usr/local/bin/git. If you instead get no response at all, you should download & install git from here: git-scm.com/downloads\n\nAn aside: Is it ncesary to have Git installed in your machine for this workshop. GitHub’s Git Guides are a really wonderful resource to start learning about this topic.\n\n\n4.1.5 Install R packages\n\nInstall the usethis and gitcreds packages in R by running the following in the RStudio Console:\n\n\ninstall.packages(“usethis”)\n\ninstall.packages(\"gitcreds\")\n\nA lot of scary looking red text will show up while this is installing - don’t panic.

    "text": "7.1 Thinking Preferences Activity\nStep 1:\n\nDon’t read ahead!! We’re headed to the patio.\n\n\n7.1.1 About the Whole Brain Thinking System\nEveryone thinks differently. The way individuals think guides the way they work, and the way groups of individuals think guides how teams work. Understanding thinking preferences facilitates effective collaboration and team work.\nThe Whole Brain Model, developed by Ned Herrmann, builds upon early conceptualizations of brain functioning. For example, the left and right hemispheres were thought to be associated with different types of information processing while our neocortex and limbic system would regulate different functions and behaviours.\n\nThe Herrmann Brain Dominance Instrument (HBDI) provides insight into dominant characteristics based on thinking preferences. There are four major thinking styles that reflect the left cerebral, left limbic, right cerebral and right limbic.\n\nAnalytical (Blue)\nPractical (Green)\nRelational (Red)\nExperimental (Yellow)\n\n\nThese four thinking styles are characterized by different traits. Those in the BLUE quadrant have a strong logical and rational side. They analyze information and may be technical in their approach to problems. They are interested in the ‘what’ of a situation. Those in the GREEN quadrant have a strong organizational and sequential side. They like to plan details and are methodical in their approach. They are interested in the ‘when’ of a situation. The RED quadrant includes those that are feelings-based in their apporach. They have strong interpersonal skills and are good communicators. They are interested in the ‘who’ of a situation. Those in the YELLOW quadrant are ideas people. They are imaginative, conceptual thinkers that explore outside the box. Yellows are interested in the ‘why’ of a situation.\n\nMost of us identify with thinking styles in more than one quadrant and these different thinking preferences reflect a complex self made up of our rational, theoretical self; our ordered, safekeeping self; our emotional, interpersonal self; and our imaginitive, experimental self.\n\nUnderstanding the complexity of how people think and process information helps us understand not only our own approach to problem solving, but also how individuals within a team can contribute. There is great value in diversity of thinking styles within collaborative teams, each type bringing strengths to different aspects of project development.\n\n\n\n7.1.2 Bonus Activity\nStep 1:\n\nRead through the statements contained within this document and determine which descriptors are most like you. Make a note of them.\nReview the descriptors again and determine which are quite like you.\nYou are working towards identifying your top 20. If you have more than 20, discard the descriptors that resonate the least.\nUsing the letter codes in the right hand column, count the number of descriptors that fall into the categories A B C and D.\n\nStep 2:\n\nScroll to the second page and copy the graphic onto a piece of paper, completing the quadrant with your scores for A, B, C and D.\n\nStep 3:\n\nReflect and share out: Do you have a dominant letter? Were some of the statements you included in your top 20 easier to resonate with than others? Were you answering based on how you are or how you wish to be?",
