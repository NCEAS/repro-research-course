      <description>Dates: November 12 - November 18, 2020Location: RemoteThis 5-day workshop will provide researchers with an overview of best data management practices, data science tools, and concrete steps and methods for more easily producing transparent, reproducible workflows. This opportunity is for researchers from across career stages and sectors who want to gain fundamental data science skills that will improve their reproducible research techniques, particularly for the purposes of synthesis science.
Curriculum at a glance: Enable data reuse through better data management  Metadata - what is it and how to write a quality data description Data modeling - tidy data for efficient access and storage Data publishing, citation, and credit  Build reproducible scientific workflows  Data munging with R tidyverse Working collaboratively - git and GitHub Writing functions in R Building packages for publishing reproducible research  Communicate results effectively  Literate analysis with RMarkdown Publishing analytical web pages with GitHub pages Data visualization with ggplot and leaflet  For more detailed information on how to prepare for the workshop, see preparing for the workshop (below).</description>
