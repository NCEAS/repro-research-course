      <title>Managing Ecological Data for Effective Use and Re-Use</title>

      <description>Friday, August 6th, 2021 10:30 AM - 1:30 PM
Session Description While graduate students in ecology learn about methods for collecting and analyzing ecological data, there is less emphasis on managing and using the resulting data effectively. This is an increasingly important skill set as the research landscape changes. Researchers are increasingly engaging in collaboration across networks, many funding agencies require data management plans, journals are requiring that data and code be accessible, and society is increasingly expecting that research be reproducible.</description>

      <title>Open Science Synthesis for the Delta Science Program</title>
      <link>/events/2021_09_delta/</link>

      <guid>/events/2021_09_delta/</guid>
      <description>We propose to hold 3 one-week facilitated synthesis and training events for Delta researchers that will revolve around scientific computing and scientific software for reproducible science. We will (1) develop an online curriculum, (2) provide data consulting, (3) include in-person training and facilitated synthesis, and (4) conduct a remote workshop to conclude the group synthesis projects.
The course will focus on techniques for data management, scientific programming, synthetic analysis, and collaboration techniques through the use of open-source, community-supported tools.</description>
